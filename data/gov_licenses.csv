By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License (""Public License""). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.

Section 1 – Definitions.

Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.
Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.
Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.
Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.
Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.
Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.
Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.
Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.
Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.
Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
Section 2 – Scope.

License grant.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and
produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.
Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).
Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.
Downstream recipients.
Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.
No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.
No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
Other rights.

Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.
Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.
To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.
Section 3 – License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.

Attribution.

If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:

retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:
identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);
a copyright notice;
a notice that refers to this Public License;
a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;
a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;
indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.
You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.
If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.
If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License.
Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;
if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.
To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.
The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.
Section 6 – Term and Termination.

This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.
Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:

automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.
Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.
Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.

The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
Section 8 – Interpretation.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.
To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.
No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.
Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
Creative Commons is not a party to its public licenses. Notwithstanding, Creative Commons may elect to apply one of its public licenses to material it publishes and in those instances will be considered the “Licensor.” The text of the Creative Commons public licenses is dedicated to the public domain under the CC0 Public Domain Dedication. Except for the limited purpose of indicating that material is shared under a Creative Commons public license or as otherwise permitted by the Creative Commons policies published at creativecommons.org/policies, Creative Commons does not authorize the use of the trademark “Creative Commons” or any other trademark or logo of Creative Commons without its prior written consent including, without limitation, in connection with any unauthorized modifications to any of its public licenses or any other arrangements, understandings, or agreements concerning use of licensed material. For the avoidance of doubt, this paragraph does not form part of the public licenses.

Licence

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENCE (""LICENCE""). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORISED UNDER THIS LICENCE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENCE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

""Collection"" means the Work in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other separate and independent works, assembled into a collective whole. A Collection may, for example, include a periodical, encyclopedia or anthology. A Collection will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purposes of this Licence.
""Derivative Work"" means material in any form that is created by editing, modifying or adapting the Work, a substantial part of the Work, or the Work and other pre-existing works. Derivative Works may, for example, include a translation, adaptation, musical arrangement, dramatisation, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be transformed or adapted, except that a Collection will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this Licence. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image (""synching"") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this Licence.
""Distribute"" means to make available to the public by any means, including publication, electronic communication, or broadcast.
""Licensor"" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this Licence.
""Original Author"" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work.
""Reproduce"" means to make a copy of the Work in any material form (eg storage in digital form).
""Work"" means the material (including any work or other subject matter) protected by copyright which is offered under the terms of this Licence. This may include (without limitation) a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work; a sound recording or cinematograph film; a published edition of a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work; or a television or sound broadcast.

2. Fair Dealing and Other Rights

Nothing in this Licence is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions under copyright law or any other applicable laws.

3. Licence Grant

3A Grant of Rights

Provided that the terms set out in this Licence are satisfied, the Licensor grants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) licence to exercise the following rights:

Reproduce the Work;
incorporate the Work into one or more Collections;
Reproduce the Work as incorporated in any Collection;
create and Reproduce one or more Derivative Works; and
Distribute and publicly perform the Work, a Derivative Work or the Work as incorporated in any Collection.
3B Media and Formats

The above rights may be exercised in any media or format whether now known or hereafter created. They include the right to make modifications that are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats.

3C Other Rights Reserved

All rights not expressly granted by the Licensor are reserved. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this Licence.

4. Restrictions

The licence granted above is limited by the following restrictions.

4A Restrictions on Distribution and Public Performance of the Work

You may Distribute and publicly perform the Work only under the terms of this Licence.
You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (such as a web link) for, this Licence with every copy of the Work You Distribute or publicly perform.
You must not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict this Licence or the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to them by this Licence.
You are not granted the right to sublicense the Work. The rights of recipients of the Work from You are governed by clause 9.
You must keep intact all notices that refer to this Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or publicly perform.
When You Distribute or publicly perform the Work, You must not impose any technological measures on it that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to them by this Licence.
For the avoidance of doubt, while this clause 4A applies to the Work as incorporated into a Collection, it does not require other material within the Collection, or the Collection apart from the Work itself, to be made subject to this Licence.
4B Attribution and Notice Requirements

When You Distribute or publicly perform the Work or any Derivative Work or Collection You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work.
When You Distribute or publicly perform the Work or any Derivative Work or Collection You must provide, in a manner reasonable to the medium or means You are using:
the name or pseudonym (if provided) of the Original Author and/or of any other party (such as a sponsor institute, publishing entity or journal) that the Original Author or Licensor has requested be attributed (such as in the copyright notice or terms of use). In this clause 4B these parties are referred to as ""Attribution Parties"";
the title of the Work (if provided); and
to the extent reasonably practicable, any Uniform Resource Identifier (such as a web link) that the Licensor specifies should be associated with the Work that refers to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work.
For any Derivative Work You Distribute or publicly perform, You must take reasonable steps to clearly identify that changes were made to the Work. For example, a translation could be marked ""The original work was translated from English to Spanish"".
In the case of a Derivative Work or Collection, the above attribution should, at a minimum, appear as part of any credits for other contributing authors and be as prominent as the credits for those other authors.
You must, to the extent practicable, remove the above attribution from any Collection or Derivative Work if requested to do so by the Licensor or Original Author.
For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this clause 4B for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above. By exercising Your rights under this Licence, You must not assert or imply:
any connection between the Original Author, Licensor or any other Attribution Party and You or Your use of the Work; or
sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor or any other Attribution Party of You or Your use of the Work,
without their separate, express prior written permission.
4C Moral Rights

Moral rights remain unaffected to the extent they are recognised and nonwaivable at law. In this clause 4C, ""moral rights"" means the personal rights granted by law to the Original Author of a copyright work. For example, Part IX of the Copyright Act 1968(Cth) grants authors the right of integrity of authorship, the right of attribution of authorship, and the right not to have authorship falsely attributed.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

Except as expressly stated in this Licence or otherwise agreed to by the parties in writing, and to the full extent permitted by applicable law, the Licensor offers the Work ""as-is"" and makes no representations, warranties or conditions of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise. This includes, without limitation, any representations, warranties or conditions regarding:
the contents or accuracy of the Work;
title, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose;
non-infringement;
the absence of latent or other defects; or
the presence or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable.
The Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), and the corresponding State and Territory fair trading legislation, imply certain warranties and conditions in certain circumstances, such as the right to supply or fitness for purpose of goods or services supplied to a consumer. Clause 5(a) cannot and is not intended to exclude, restrict or modify these warranties.
6. Limit of Liability

To the full extent permitted by applicable law, and except for any liability arising from contrary agreement, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal basis (including without limitation, negligence) for any loss or damage whatsoever, including (without limitation):
loss of production or operation time, loss, damage or corruption of data or records; or
loss of anticipated savings, opportunity, revenue, profit or goodwill, or other economic loss; or
any special, incidental, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages arising out of or in connection with this Licence or the use of the Work, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
If applicable legislation implies warranties or conditions, or imposes obligations or liability on the Licensor in respect of this Licence that cannot be wholly or partly excluded, restricted or modified, the Licensor’s liability is limited, to the full extent permitted by the applicable legislation, at its option, to:
in the case of goods, any one or more of the following:
the replacement of the goods or the supply of equivalent goods;
the repair of the goods;
the payment of the cost of replacing the goods or of acquiring equivalent goods;
the payment of the cost of having the goods repaired; or
in the case of services:
the supplying of the services again; or
the payment of the cost of having the services supplied again.
The Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), and the corresponding State and Territory fair trading legislation, restrict the limitation of liability in certain circumstances, such as a contract for the supply of goods or services of a kind ordinarily acquired for personal, domestic, or household use. Clauses 6(a) and 6(b) cannot and are not intended to apply in circumstances where it is prohibited by law.
7. Termination

This Licence and the rights granted to You under this Licence shall terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of the Licence. Individuals or entities who have received a Derivative Work or a Collection from You pursuant to this Licence, however, will not have their licences terminated provided they remain in full compliance with those licences. Clauses 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 shall survive any termination of this Licence.

8. Licensor’s Rights Retained

Subject to the above terms, the Licence granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding this, the Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different licence terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time. However, any such release will not serve to withdraw this Licence (or any other licence that has been granted under the terms of this Licence), and this Licence will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

9. Licence Grant to Recipients of the Work from You

Each time You Distribute or publicly perform the Work, a Derivative Work or a Collection the Licensor offers the recipient a licence to the Work on the same terms as are granted to You under this Licence.

10. Severability

If any provision of this Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Licence. Without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

11. Waivers and Consents

No term of this Licence shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent is in writing and signed by the relevant party.

12. Entire Agreement

This Licence constitutes the entire agreement between the parties. To the full extent permitted by law, there are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This Licence may not be modified without the written agreement of the Licensor and You.

13. Governing Law

The construction, validity and performance of this Licence shall be governed by the laws in force in the Australian Capital Territory, Australia.

Creative Commons is not a party to this Licence, and, to the full extent permitted by applicable law, makes no representation or warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. To the full extent permitted by applicable law, Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this licence. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor. Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is licensed under the Licence, neither party will use the trademark ""Creative Commons"" or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted use will be in compliance with Creative Commons’ then-current trademark usage guidelines, as may be published on its website or otherwise made available upon request from time to time.

1. Definitions

""Collective Work"" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopaedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole.

3. Licence Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Licence, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) licence to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor under this Licence are hereby reserved.
4. Restrictions. The licence granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

You may publish, communicate to the public, distribute, publicly exhibit or display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this Licence, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this Licence with every copy or record of the Work You publish, communicate to the public, distribute, publicly exhibit or display, publicly perform or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that exclude, alter or restrict the terms of this Licence or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this Licence and to the disclaimer of representations and warranties. You may not publish, communicate to the public, distribute, publicly exhibit or display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this Licence. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this Licence. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.
If you publish, communicate to the public, distribute, publicly exhibit or display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work. You must also give clear and reasonably prominent credit to (i) the Original Author (by name or pseudonym if applicable), if the name or pseudonym is supplied; and (ii) if another party or parties (eg a sponsor institute, publishing entity or journal) is designated for attribution in the copyright notice, terms of service or other reasonable means associated with the Work, such party or parties. If applicable, that credit must be given in the particular way made known by the Original Author and otherwise as reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing, by conveying the identity of the Original Author and the other designated party or parties (if applicable); the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., ""French translation of the Work by Original Author,"" or ""Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"").

If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's Licence You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public Licence.Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.Where the Licenced Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licenced Material:a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; andc. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public Licence where the Licenced Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licenced Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licenced Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.26 February 2016

Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.Section 6 – Term and Termination.a. This Public Licence applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public Licence, then Your rights under this Public Licence terminate automatically.b. Where Your right to use the Licenced Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public Licence.c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licenced Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licenced Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public Licence.d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public Licence.Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licenced Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public Licence.Section 8 – Interpretation.a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public Licence does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licenced Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public Licence.b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public Licence is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public Licence without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.c. No term or condition of this Public Licence will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.d. Nothing in this Public Licence constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.",,

http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/disseminacao/eventos/missao/principios_fundamentais_orientacoes_divulgacoes.shtm,Brazil,statistics,,,Terms of use,Bespoke,,,,,"Princípios Fundamentais das Estatísticas Oficiais: orientações para divulgações de resultados pelo IBGE
Introdução
A integridade das estatísticas oficiais e a confiança pública nessas estatísticas são fundamentais para a sociedade e para os governos. Para que exista essa confiança pública, é essencial assegurar a credibilidade das instituições encarregadas de sua produção.
Nesse contexto, a adoção, pelo IBGE, dos “Princípios Fundamentais das Estatísticas Oficiais”, estabelecidos pela Comissão de Estatística das Nações Unidas em 19941 e aprovados pela Assembleia Geral das Nações Unidas em janeiro de 2014, torna transparentes as principais orientações de sua prática institucional, de acordo com o preconizado por aquela Comissão, contribuindo para a construção de sua credibilidade enquanto órgão oficial de estatística do País.
Estatísticas oficiais são informações produzidas e disseminadas por agências governamentais, em bases regulares, regidas pela legislação em matéria de estatística e/ou regulamentos administrativos, sujeitas ao cumprimento de um sistema padronizado de conceitos, definições, unidades estatísticas, classificações, nomenclaturas e códigos, visando retratar as condições econômicas, sociais e ambientais; fornecer subsídios para o planejamento, a execução e o acompanhamento de políticas públicas; propiciar suporte técnico para tomadas de decisões; e consolidar o exercício da cidadania.
O objeto das considerações deste documento diz respeito, mais diretamente, ao Princípio de nº 1 – abaixo reproduzido -, que estabelece a forma como a divulgação de estatísticas oficiais deve se dar.
Princípio 1: Relevância, imparcialidade e igualdade de acesso

As estatísticas oficiais constituem um elemento indispensável no sistema de informação de uma sociedade democrática, oferecendo ao governo, à economia e ao público dados sobre a situação econômica, demográfica social e ambiental. Com esta finalidade, os órgãos oficiais de estatística devem produzir e divulgar, de forma imparcial, estatísticas de utilidade prática comprovada, para honrar o direito do cidadão à informação pública.
Assim sendo, o IBGE tem como um de seus objetivos assegurar que as informações que produz sejam divulgadas com imparcialidade e com igualdade de acesso por todos os usuários, sem privilégios.
A garantia da igualdade de acesso encontra-se, sobretudo, no âmbito das ações e práticas da própria Instituição. Já a garantia da imparcialidade diz respeito não só às diretrizes institucionais quanto à forma de apresentação de resultados, às situações a serem evitadas e aos cuidados a serem observados na divulgação, mas também, em boa medida, à esfera comportamental dos técnicos responsáveis pelas divulgações de resultados.
Esses técnicos desempenham um papel institucional fundamental, pois participam de etapa decisiva no cumprimento da missão do IBGE. No momento da divulgação, os técnicos não falam em seu próprio nome, mas em nome do IBGE. Nesse momento, representam a Instituição perante a sociedade, e devem estar conscientes e convictos desse papel. E o IBGE, como órgão oficial de estatística, deve atender aos Princípios Fundamentais das Estatísticas Oficiais das Nações Unidas, entre eles, o Princípio nº 1, que é explícito quanto à necessidade de imparcialidade na divulgação.
A imparcialidade é, por conseguinte, uma dimensão complexa e difícil, pois envolve, além das práticas institucionais, a subjetividade individual dos técnicos. Assim sendo, para alcançá-la, é preciso que haja trabalho compartilhado entre a Instituição e seus técnicos, cabendo estabelecer orientações que possam tornar transparentes os principais critérios das boas práticas da divulgação de estatísticas oficiais.
Em 2013, o IBGE publicou seu Código de Boas Práticas das Estatísticas2, constituído por um conjunto de diretrizes, estruturado por princípios e indicadores de boas práticas. Nele, dois princípios chamam atenção, juntamente com seus respectivos indicadores, a saber: Imparcialidade e Objetividade (Princípio 7) e Acessibilidade e Transparência (Princípio 17).
Nesse sentido, este documento procura fornecer algumas recomendações básicas que se relacionam com a apresentação e divulgação de estatísticas oficiais, tanto na forma escrita como falada, quanto ao aspecto da imparcialidade, visando à implementação de critérios que garantam sua observância.
Assim, as recomendações descritas se aplicam no contexto de divulgações institucionais, não sendo extensivas para textos assinados, onde por iniciativa própria, e não por demanda da instituição, servidores do IBGE submetem artigos em eventos como congressos, seminários e afins, com a chamada de que “O IBGE está isento de qualquer responsabilidade pelas opiniões, informações, dados e conceitos emitidos no artigo, que são de exclusiva responsabilidade dos autores.”
Antes, porém, são indicadas as principais ações do IBGE no que se refere à garantia da igualdade de acesso às informações produzidas.

1) A igualdade de acesso na divulgação de estatísticas oficiais e as ações no IBGE
Para garantir a igualdade de acesso, o IBGE atua em duas vertentes principais. Uma delas está voltada, diretamente, para os procedimentos de divulgação ao público e a outra é relativa aos procedimentos adotados no processo de produção dos resultados das informações de natureza estatística.
No que diz respeito aos procedimentos de divulgação, o IBGE oferece vários meios de acesso e obtenção das informações, com vistas a melhor atender o público, em geral, seja por meio de publicações ou disponibilizando produtos e serviços eletrônicos.
Em dezembro de cada ano são disseminados, pela Internet, os calendários de divulgação dos resultados de pesquisas para todo o ano seguinte, indicando o dia da divulgação dos indicadores conjunturais e o mês da divulgação das diversas estatísticas das pesquisas estruturais ou especiais. Possibilita-se, dessa forma, que todos possam conhecer, com antecedência, as datas em que terão acesso às informações.
Na divulgação de resultados com realização de coletiva de imprensa, o release é disponibilizado para os participantes no início do evento. Simultaneamente, os indicadores e comentários sobre os resultados são disponibilizados no portal do IBGE na Internet. Esta sistemática de divulgação, com disponibilização para o domínio público de forma ordenada, padronizada e transparente, garante a igualdade de acesso e promove a confiança do público nos procedimentos da Instituição.
No que se refere à produção dos resultados, o IBGE limita o acesso prévio ao lançamento público dos resultados das pesquisas àqueles técnicos responsáveis pelo processo de produção dos dados e sua disponibilização, através de publicação convencional, mídia eletrônica ou Internet.
Cabe citar a questão da precedência como uma exceção no que se refere à simultaneidade na disseminação de resultados. De acordo com as normas estabelecidas, o IBGE confere a precedência para autoridades do Governo, sempre preservando o princípio da transparência, com acesso controlado e de conhecimento público. No caso, a precedência de indicadores conjunturais encontra-se prevista na Portaria nº 355, de 05/11/20073, e a precedência dos resultados das pesquisas estruturais ou especiais está prevista na Portaria nº 15, de 27/01/20054, ambas do Ministério do Planejamento, Orçamento e Gestão.
Conforme estabelece a Portaria nº 355, acima citada, os resultados de pesquisas conjunturais devem ser informados para as autoridades da lista de precedência duas horas antes da divulgação ao público, ou seja, às 7h, e a disseminação ao público se dá às 9h do mesmo dia. A lista de nomes das autoridades contempladas pela precedência e dos respectivos cargos é apresentada, sempre atualizada, no portal do IBGE na Internet.
No caso das pesquisas estruturais ou especiais, objeto da Portaria nº 15, a precedência contempla, apenas, o titular do Ministério do Planejamento, Orçamento e Gestão, e os resultados são encaminhados com antecedência de quarenta e oito horas do horário fixado para a divulgação. Também se encontra regulamentada, pela R.CD nº 07/2014, a antecipação de resultados, com quarenta e oito horas de antecedência, à instituições parceiras que atuarem na qualidade de patrocinadoras e/ou coautoras de pesquisas e/ou estudos ou de produtos decorrentes de Acordos ou Termos de Cooperação.
Além disso, cabe mencionar a prática do embargo para a imprensa, que ocorre apenas para as pesquisas estruturais e especiais, que consiste em antecipar para os veículos de comunicação as informações, com o mesmo período de antecedência que estabelece a Portaria nº 15 acima referida, e com o compromisso de os jornalistas só divulgarem em data e horário estabelecidos pelo IBGE. Essa prática contribui para a melhor preparação da matéria a ser veiculada sobre as informações produzidas.

2) A imparcialidade na divulgação de estatísticas oficiais: ações e orientações no IBGE
Um aspecto fundamental na divulgação de estatísticas oficiais é a questão da imparcialidade, que se encontra relacionada à própria natureza de um órgão oficial de estatística e à sua imagem institucional. O papel da análise de dados na divulgação das estatísticas oficiais do país é viabilizar a melhor compreensão possível das informações, sem implicações valorativas. A credibilidade e o entendimento dos dados que estão sendo apresentados são os aspectos prioritários da divulgação.
É fundamental para a credibilidade do órgão oficial de estatística o reconhecimento, pela sociedade, de sua imparcialidade como produtor e disseminador de informações, para que todos os usuários possam ter confiança nos resultados como representação de aspectos relevantes da sociedade.
A imparcialidade é o direito de todos (sociedade e governo) à informação pública de qualidade e de utilidade, com garantia de igualdade de acesso e sem nenhuma interferência no retrato produzido ou na interpretação, que possa influenciar na isenção com que o dado deve ser apresentado.
A questão está em assegurar, efetivamente, que o órgão oficial de estatística seja imparcial. Ainda que a apreciação dos usuários com relação aos resultados e suas opiniões sobre as possíveis implicações sejam muito diferentes entre si, todos devem reconhecer os resultados como retrato da realidade. Assim sendo, a análise e a divulgação dos dados devem ser realizadas no sentido de promover esse reconhecimento.
A imparcialidade na produção e disseminação de estatísticas oficiais pode ser reconhecida através de algumas ações adotadas pelo IBGE, descritas nos itens seguintes:
Dar acesso à mesma informação e ao mesmo tempo para todos os usuários (igualdade de acesso e simultaneidade na disseminação).

Garantir o uso público das informações produzidas, independentemente de qual tenha sido a fonte de financiamento.

Implantar e executar uma política de disseminação sistemática. Todos os resultados liberados têm de ser acessíveis ao público. Não há resultados caracterizados como oficiais que sejam para uso exclusivo do governo ou de qualquer outro agente.

Estabelecer calendários de divulgação que indicam antecipadamente o dia de divulgação dos indicadores conjunturais e o mês de divulgação das diversas estatísticas das pesquisas estruturais ou especiais.

Explicitar as razões para qualquer alteração na data de lançamento anunciada nos calendários de divulgação, que só deve ocorrer a partir de critérios técnicos.

Ser absolutamente livre de interferências externas, sobre o quê e como divulgar.

Divulgar os resultados considerando os critérios de natureza estritamente estatística, ou seja, acompanhados de documentação sobre as práticas estatísticas, tais como: fontes de informação, conceitos, classificações, métodos e processos adotados para permitir a correta interpretação dos dados pelos usuários.

Comunicar amplamente aos usuários, antecipadamente, sobre mudanças metodológicas ou de conteúdo ou de formato das divulgações.

Garantir a isenção na apresentação dos resultados é também exercitar a capacidade de dirigentes e técnicos de modo a não permitir que ela seja influenciada pelas opiniões e convicções pessoais. Nesse sentido, é importante que o órgão oficial de estatística esteja atento, também, ao conteúdo e à forma de apresentação dos resultados, como mais uma medida com vistas a promover a imparcialidade.
Usualmente, a apresentação de resultados é acompanhada de um exercício analítico dos dados produzidos. A análise de dados é o processo pelo qual se dá ordem, estrutura, interpretação e significado aos dados. A análise permite diferentes abordagens e requer extremo cuidado na interpretação, destacando-se que, nos comentários analíticos, sejam eles veiculados em textos para divulgação ou em apresentações orais, devem ser observadas as seguintes características:
- objetividade - evitar incluir na análise elementos subjetivos, sujeitos a visões políticas ou teóricas distintas. Qualquer que seja o resultado, ele deve ser apresentado de forma a retratar fielmente o levantamento do dado, independentemente das preferências individuais ou impactos para alguns usuários (ser ""boa"" ou ""má"" notícia). Além de ferir o princípio da imparcialidade, o juízo de valor e a adjetivação podem dificultar a compreensão do público em geral, ou tirar o foco da atenção das informações que estão sendo divulgadas;
- neutralidade – na interpretação dos dados, as declarações devem ser feitas sem refletir conflitos de interesse, evitando que possam ser interpretadas como comentário político;
- não deduzir determinados resultados sem comprovação direta dos dados - limitar a análise aos dados levantados e ao período de referência das informações que estão sendo divulgadas e aos valores da série histórica. Não especular sobre resultados futuros dos dados que estão sendo divulgados ou de fatores que irão influenciá-los. A prospecção não é objeto de estatísticas oficiais, com exceção para as Projeções de População e para as previsões de safras agrícolas do Levantamento Sistemático da Produção Agrícola – LSPA, pela própria natureza das informações.
Quanto ao estilo e conteúdo para a apresentação das informações, devem ser observadas, ainda, as seguintes orientações:
- facilitar entendimento e usar descrição factual, compreensiva, em linguagem clara e direta;
- utilizar conceitos na análise e divulgação que estejam claramente descritos e sejam aceitos amplamente, com preferência para o uso dos termos técnicos consolidados;
- utilizar parâmetros objetivos nas análises dos dados. Por exemplo, frases com termos ""maior"" ou ""pequeno"" devem ter uma referência concreta e objetiva;
- manter formatos padrões para a apresentação dos resultados, de acordo com a natureza da informação, pois pode facilitar a compreensão, em especial se são realizadas comparações consistentes ao longo do tempo.",,"Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics: guidelines for disclosure of results by IBGE
Introduction
The integrity of official statistics and public confidence in these statistics are fundamental to society and to governments. For this public confidence to exist, it is essential to ensure the credibility of the institutions responsible for its production.
In this context, the adoption by the IBGE of the ""Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics"", established by the United Nations Statistical Commission in 1994 1 and approved by the United Nations General Assembly in January 2014, makes transparent the main orientations of its practice Institutional, as recommended by that Commission, contributing to the construction of its credibility as official statistical agency of the Country.
Official statistics are information produced and disseminated by government agencies, on a regular basis, governed by statistical legislation and / or administrative regulations, subject to compliance with a standardized system of concepts, definitions, statistical units, classifications, nomenclatures and codes, aiming at Portraying economic, social and environmental conditions; Provide subsidies for the planning, execution and monitoring of public policies; Provide technical support for decision making; And consolidate the exercise of citizenship.
The object of the considerations in this document relates more directly to the Principle # 1 - below reproduced - which establishes how the disclosure of official statistics should take place.
Principle 1: Relevance, impartiality and equal access 

Official statistics are an indispensable element in the information system of a democratic society, providing the government, the economy and the public with data on the economic, demographic, social and environmental situation. To this end, statutory statistical bodies should produce and disseminate, in an impartial manner, statistics of proven practical utility, in order to honor the citizen's right to public information.
Thus, IBGE has as one of its objectives to ensure that the information it produces is imparted impartially and with equal access by all users, without privileges.
The guarantee of equality of access lies above all in the scope of the institution's own actions and practices. The impartiality guarantee, however, concerns not only the institutional guidelines as to the presentation of results, the situations to be avoided and the care to be observed in the disclosure, but also, to a great extent, the behavioral sphere of the technicians responsible for disclosure of Results.
These technicians play a fundamental institutional role, as they participate in a decisive step in fulfilling the IBGE mission. At the time of the disclosure, the technicians do not speak in their own name, but on behalf of IBGE. At that moment, they represent the institution before society, and they must be aware and convinced of this role. And IBGE, as the official statistical agency, must comply with the United Nations Official Statistics Fundamental Principles, including Principle 1, which is explicit as to the need for impartiality in disclosure.
Impartiality is, therefore, a complex and difficult dimension, since it involves, in addition to institutional practices, the individual subjectivity of technicians. Therefore, in order to achieve this, there must be shared work between the Institution and its technicians, and it is necessary to establish guidelines that can make transparent the main criteria for good practices in the dissemination of official statistics.
In 2013, the IBGE published its Code of Good Practices in Statistics 2 , consisting of a set of guidelines, structured by principles and indicators of good practices. In it, two principles call attention, together with their respective indicators, namely: Impartiality and Objectivity (Principle 7) and Accessibility and Transparency (Principle 17).
In this sense, this document seeks to provide some basic recommendations that relate to the presentation and dissemination of official statistics, both in written and spoken form, as well as the impartiality aspect, aiming at the implementation of criteria that guarantee its observance.
Thus, the recommendations described apply in the context of institutional disclosures, not being extended to signed texts, where on their own initiative, and not by request of the institution, IBGE's servers submit articles in events such as congresses, seminars and the like, with the call of That ""IBGE is exempt from any responsibility for the opinions, information, data and concepts emitted in the article, which are the sole responsibility of the authors.""
Before, however, the main actions of the IBGE regarding the guarantee of equal access to the information produced are indicated.

1) Equality of access in the dissemination of official statistics and actions in IBGE
In order to ensure equal access, IBGE operates in two main strands. One of them is directed directly to the public disclosure procedures and the other is related to the procedures adopted in the process of producing the results of statistical information.
With regard to disclosure procedures, IBGE offers various means of accessing and obtaining information, in order to better serve the public, in general, either through publications or by providing electronic products and services.
In December of each year the calendars of dissemination of research results for the whole of the following year are disseminated through the Internet, indicating the day of the dissemination of the conjuncture indicators and the month of the dissemination of the various statistics of structural or special research. In this way, it is possible for everyone to know, in advance, the dates on which they will have access to the information.
In the dissemination of results with the holding of a press conference, the release is made available to the participants at the beginning of the event. Simultaneously, the indicators and comments on the results are available on the IBGE website. This disclosure system, which is made publicly available in an orderly, standardized and transparent manner, guarantees equal access and promotes public confidence in the Institution's procedures.
Regarding the production of the results, the IBGE limits the previous access to the public launching of the results of the research to those technicians responsible for the process of producing the data and its availability through conventional publication, electronic media or Internet.
It is worth mentioning the issue of precedence as an exception when it comes to simultaneity in the dissemination of results. According to the established standards, IBGE gives precedence to Government authorities, always preserving the principle of transparency, with controlled access and public knowledge. In case, the precedence of short - term indicators are provided for in Ordinance No. 355 of 05/11/2007 3 , and the precedence of the results of structural or special surveys is provided in Ordinance No. 15 of 27/01/2005 4 , Both from the Ministry of Planning, Budget and Management.
As established by Administrative Rule 355, cited above, the results of short-term research must be informed to the authorities of the precedence list two hours before the disclosure to the public, that is, at 7 am, and dissemination to the public occurs at 9:00 am day. The list of names of the authorities contemplated by the precedence and respective positions is presented, always updated, in the IBGE Internet portal.
In the case of structural or special surveys, object of Ordinance No. 15, the precedence only includes the holder of the Ministry of Planning, Budget and Management, and the results are forwarded forty-eight hours in advance of the time set for the disclosure. It is also regulated by R.CD No. 07/2014, the anticipation of results, forty-eight hours in advance, to partner institutions that act as sponsors and / or co-authors of research and / or studies or resulting products Of Agreements or Terms of Cooperation.
In addition, it is worth mentioning the practice of the embargo on the press, which occurs only for structural and special investigations, which consists in anticipating information for the vehicles of communication, with the same period of time as established by Administrative Rule 15 above, And with the commitment of journalists to only disclose in a date and time established by IBGE. This practice contributes to the better preparation of the material to be transmitted on the information produced.

2) The impartiality in the dissemination of official statistics: actions and guidelines in IBGE
A fundamental aspect in the dissemination of official statistics is the issue of impartiality, which is related to the very nature of an official statistical body and its institutional image. The role of data analysis in the dissemination of the official statistics of the country is to make possible the best possible understanding of the information, without any value implications. The credibility and understanding of the data being presented are the priority aspects of the disclosure.
It is fundamental to the credibility of the official statistical agency the recognition, by society, of its impartiality as a producer and disseminator of information, so that all users can have confidence in the results as a representation of relevant aspects of society.
Impartiality is the right of everyone (society and government) to public information of quality and utility, with a guarantee of equal access and without any interference in the portrait produced or in the interpretation, which may influence the exemption with which the data must be presented .
The point is to ensure that the official statistical body is impartial. Although users' appreciation of results and their opinions about possible implications are very different from one another, everyone should recognize the results as a picture of reality. Therefore, the analysis and dissemination of the data must be carried out in order to promote such recognition.
The impartiality in the production and dissemination of official statistics can be recognized through some actions adopted by the IBGE, described in the following items:
Give access to the same information and at the same time to all users (equality of access and simultaneity in the dissemination).

Ensure the public use of the information produced, regardless of the source of funding.

Implement and implement a policy of systematic dissemination. All released results must be accessible to the public. There are no results characterized as officers that are for the exclusive use of the government or any other agent.

Establish disclosure calendars that indicate in advance the day of disclosure of the conjunctural indicators and the month of dissemination of the various structural or special research statistics.

Explain the reasons for any change in the release date announced in the release calendars, which should only occur from technical criteria.

Be absolutely free from outside interference, about what and how to disclose.

To disseminate the results considering strictly statistical criteria, that is, accompanied by documentation on statistical practices, such as: sources of information, concepts, classifications, methods and processes adopted to allow the correct interpretation of data by users.

Broadly communicate to users, in advance, about methodological changes or content or format of disclosures.

Ensuring the exemption in the presentation of results is also exercising the capacity of leaders and technicians so as not to allow it to be influenced by personal opinions and beliefs. In this sense, it is important that the official statistical agency also pay attention to the content and presentation of the results, as a further measure to promote impartiality.
Usually, the presentation of results is accompanied by an analytical exercise of the data produced. Data analysis is the process by which order, structure, interpretation, and meaning are given to the data. The analysis allows for different approaches and requires extreme care in interpretation. It should be emphasized that, in the analytical comments, they are transmitted in texts for dissemination or in oral presentations, the following characteristics must be observed:
- objectivity - avoid including in the analysis subjective elements, subject to different political or theoretical visions. Whatever the outcome, it should be presented in a way that accurately portrays the survey of the data, regardless of individual preferences or impacts to some users (""good"" or ""bad"" news). Besides jeopardizing the principle of impartiality, value judgment and adjectivation can make it difficult for the general public to understand, or to focus attention on the information being disseminated;
- neutrality - in the interpretation of the data, the statements must be made without reflecting conflicts of interest, avoiding that they can be interpreted as political commentary;
- not to deduct certain results without direct evidence of the data - to limit the analysis to the data collected and to the period of reference of the information being disseminated and to the values ​​of the historical series. Do not speculate on future results of the data being released or factors that will influence them. Prospecting is not the subject of official statistics, except for the Population Projections and for the agricultural crop forecast of the Systematic Survey of Agricultural Production - LSPA, by the very nature of the information.
Regarding the style and content for the presentation of information, the following guidelines should also be observed:
- facilitate understanding and use factual, comprehensive description in clear and direct language;
- use analysis and disclosure concepts that are clearly described and widely accepted, with preference for the use of consolidated technical terms;
- use objective parameters in data analysis. For example, phrases with ""greater"" or ""small"" terms must have a concrete and objective reference;
- maintain standard formats for presentation of results, according to the nature of the information, as it may facilitate understanding, especially if consistent comparisons are made over time."

Terms of use and disclaimer 
 
Introduction
 
By accessing the internet site https://my.publicprocurement.be and its e-Notification, e-Tendering, e-Auction, e-Awarding and e-Catalogue components, including the practice sites available via https://mydemo.publicprocurement.be, and by using these sites, users acknowledge that they have familiarised themselves with the conditions for using the e-Procurement service run by Federal Public Service Personnel and Organisation (referred to hereinafter as FPS P&O) and have accepted them in their entirety.
The user is expected to consult the conditions for use on a regular basis, particularly if the FPS P&O announces changes in conditions using any methods it selects.
 
A. Use of services
 
The services can be used freely, although some require registration at no charge. Also consult part B entitled “Your private life”  in order to find out how we manage our data.
Some actions relating to our applications require some prior knowledge. This knowledge may be obtained using the following means:
 
- by thoroughly reading our manuals and check-lists ( in English click here        in French:  entreprise / acheteur )
- by obtaining information from the FPS P&O helpdesk (our details can be found at the bottom of the page)
- by taking part in information sessions and/or training (in French (entreprise / acheteur ) (whether or not organised by FPS P&O)
- by consulting other channels not managed by FPS P&O.
 
Apart from using the applications, you must also master the legislation relating to procurement contracts.
You must act at all times in accordance with the legislation on procurement contracts, even if an application leaves you free to act otherwise.
 
The services may include – in a non-comprehensive way – email, uploading and downloading, signature, auction, forum, publication modules, search engines and/or other communication services and exchange services, designed to allow procurement contracts to be dealt with in their entirety.
You undertake only to use the above services for the following purposes:
 
- posting appropriate messages and
- sending material whose content is legal
and which, where applicable, are related to these.
 
For example – and without this list being comprehensive – you undertake, by using the communications services, not to:
 
• use the services as part of pyramid schemes, chain letters, junk mail, spam or other unsolicited or undesirable mail.
• libel, harass or threaten anyone, or infringe anyone’s rights in any other way.
• publish, put on line, upload to a server, distribute or circulate any inappropriate,  insulting or illegal subject, fact or information.
• upload, or make available in any other way, files containing images, photographs, software or other elements protected by the law on intellectual property, including, in particular, copyright or trademark rights (or by human rights, including herein the right to a private life), unless you hold said rights, you exercise legal control over these or you have received all the necessary authorisation.
• infringe on third party rights concerning copyrights, trademarks, patents, industrial secrets or other property rights
• upload files containing viruses, especially of the Trojan Horse or worm type, time bomb, cancelbots, corrupted files or any other software or similar programme likely to harm the way a computer belonging to another person functions or to damage someone else’s property.
• falsify any information or delete any information without the authorisation of the person concerned.
• restrict or prevent the use and enjoyment of communications services by any other user who is not part of your organisation.
• violate any code of conduct or any other instructions which may apply to a particular service.
• violate the applicable laws and regulations.
• create a false identity with the intention of deceiving another person.
• circulate details to third parties and in particular to competitors.
 
No illegal or prohibited use
 
You may only use the services if you can guarantee that you will not be using them for illegal purposes or those prohibited by these conditions for use. You must not use the services in a way likely to damage, hamper, overload or impede the operations of a server run by FPS P&O or its partners or by a network connected to this, or in a way likely to disrupt the use and enjoyment of the services by another person.
You are not authorised to circumvent any ban on accessing a service, other accounts, computer systems or networks connected to a server or an aforementioned service, by means of computer piracy (hacking), password extraction or using any other means. You are prohibited from obtaining or attempting to obtain any fact or information using a method other than those made available to you by the services.
Data that you can only consult through being connected is confidential and cannot under any circumstances be communicated to third parties.
Some data of this type are given here as an example: price of a catalogue, content of a tender, personal details, etc.
 
Your liability: associated with the application and the organisation
 
If you are acting as the manager of an organisation and this organisation is
 
a) a company
 
- you must update the software on your computer on a regular basis, in particular  the operating system (such as Windows, Mac OS, etc.), the browser (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, Chrome, etc.), Java (www.java.com) and the software associated with the digital signature method you have chosen.
- the applications operate using a personal account and not a business account. You are responsible for the company data indicated in your personal account and for updating it.
- you are responsible for protecting your username and your password on our applications. You must do your utmost to ensure that this information is secure and to prevent its circulation. If you nevertheless communicate this data, this is subject to your own entire responsibility.
- you are obliged to immediately change the password you have been allocated by the helpdesk or by our application (the only exception is the password you have been allocated with the invitation to take part in a restricted file. You cannot change this password).
- you can only be connected to the same account on one single piece of equipment at a time. On this piece of equipment you can only connect up with one browser using your account. Before changing browser, you must close down the browser using the browser menu bar and not using the small cross.
- you are responsible for monitoring procurement contracts on the e-Notification platform, even if you are using messaging. Failure to receive a message or lack of information in the message service cannot under any circumstances give rise to any compensation.
- although the internet sites mentioned in the contract notice contain all kinds of information (contract title, registration deadline, and so on), the contract notice is and remains the sole correct reference and this must be used as an authentic source.
- you are expected to be initiating a contract on schedule. This responsibility applies to all phases of the process, particularly to downloading to the server and signing the bid or the participation request.
 
- if the form for electronic registration has been activated by the contracting authority, you must fill in the correct data as bidder.
- as bidder, you make sure that the right person(s) sign(s) the bid (agent or representative).
The digital signature must comply with Directive 1999/93/CE of the European Parliament and the Council of 13 December 1999 within a community framework for digital signatures AND with art. 52 §1st, 1° of A.R. of 15/07/2011 .
This regulation indicates that the digital signature must be generated with a qualified certificate, issued on a secure medium. Secure media refer in particular to a Belgian identity card, a USB key, a smartcard, and so on,  issued in person by the certification authority (therefore not by post or on line).
If using a mandate, this must satisfy legal requirements (see art. 82 §3 R.D. 15/07/2011) and, depending on the case, be added to the bid, lodged with the contracting authority or refer to the number in the Belgian Monitor.
You will find some examples of a mandate here.
 
- the company is responsible for appointing the right people who will be able to access a file in e-Catalogue, with a view to managing catalogues and orders in e-Catalogue, and for notifying this information to the awarding authority which manages the file.
- the company is responsible for informing the awarding authority in good time of any changes relating to the people who may access the files in e-Catalogue.
- if orders are placed in e-Catalogue relating to one of your company’s catalogues, you are responsible for supervising these orders, even if e-Catalogue sends out automatic notifications. Failure to receive a notification or lack of information in the notification cannot under any circumstances give rise to any compensation.
- after receiving the invitation to an electronic reverse auction, as representative you are expected to initiate operations on schedule in order to access the system and to meet all the technical requirements.
- as representative, you are responsible for indicating the correct value of the bid in an electronic reverse auction.
 
b) an organisation which is going to award a procurement contract (from the market study to fulfilment)
 
- you are responsible for protecting your username and your password on our applications. You must do your utmost to ensure that this data is secure and to prevent its circulation. However if you communicate this data, this is your own entire responsibility.
- you are obliged to immediately change the password you have been attributed by the helpdesk or by our application.
- you can only be connected to the same account on one single piece of equipment at a time. On this piece of equipment you can only connect up with one browser using your account.  Before changing browser, you must close down the browser using the browser menu bar and not using the small cross.
If you have a superuser role, you are then responsible for the use of e-Procurement applications within your organisation.
You must develop a structure within your organisation in which you will determine which departments will execute procurement contracts. You must register these departments on the e-Procurement platform. You must then create an access management system: who is entitled to publish a notice, who can receive a bid, and so on. Lastly, you must circulate the FPS P&O message throughout your organisation.
 
Please find below a non-comprehensive list of functions and characteristics that may help you within this framework.
 
• You are the first premier point of contact between  the (sub-)organisation and FPS P&O
• You can create sub-organisations
• You can accept/exclude users for an organisation
• You can change a user's roles 
• You can change data about users and (sub- organisations)
• You can approve/reject the profiles created by the  user (more precisely the modified roles)
• You can ask the helpdesk to delete users.
 
Each user action by means of which the user asks to change his mandates or by means of which a sub-organisation is created will lead to you receiving an email. You will still need to approve or reject said action on the website. The e-Procurement service will never process user requests on its own initiative. Users will be referred to the superuser, who in turn can perform the necessary actions (and/or call upon the helpdesk if necessary). If the user states that the superuser known to us no longer holds this role, the organisation needs to appoint a new superuser first. The superuser can then perform the necessary actions (and/or call upon the helpdesk if necessary). 
 
In addition you must comply with the laws and executory decisions necessary in relation to procurement contracts. You must publish your notice in accordance with the rules of good practice.
 
Although e-Notification makes you numerous pre-programmed suggestions (such as using the e-Tendering platform by default, a possible opening date, etc.), you yourself must check the extent to which these suggestions correspond to your contract.
 
You are responsible for the content of the notice, the contract documents downloaded onto the server, the content of the record of the opening of the bids and any other basic aspects associated with the means of communication you use. You must submit a complete and correct communication.
 
Consequently be careful about the information you communicate before giving your approval about a publication or before answering a question on the forum.
 
If you accept electronic bids or requests for participation, you must complete and activate the parameters in the e-Tendering file on the date of publication.
Electronic opening procedures cannot be organised for Friday afternoons (from 12h00 to 23h59). FPS P&O has set aside this time slot for carrying out planned maintenance work.
If you are nevertheless organising an opening procedure for this time, FPS P&O cannot then guarantee that you will be able to use the e-Tendering application.
After the opening procedure, you must immediately store the files you have received on a secure server you yourself manage.
After the date of closing the file (consult the file on e-Notification under the heading Data about management and e-Tendering in Parameters), FPS P&O shall close down the file. In concrete terms this means that the contractual documents shall no longer be made available to companies and they will actually be deleted in full after 5 years. For e Tendering, only the record of the opening of the bids shall remain available after the file has been closed. The documents received (bid, digital signatures) are then definitively deleted from our servers.
 
If you want to offer a contract via e-Catalogue, you must create a file in e-Catalogue. You must activate this file to make it visible.
You are responsible for the visibility of your file. By default, the file is only visible to your organisation. The application offers the functions necessary for sharing it – if necessary – with the appropriate organisations.
You are responsible for monitoring and managing the catalogues you have downloaded or those which are present in a file, even if e-Catalogue sends out automatic notifications in certain cases. Failure to receive a notification or lack of information in the notification cannot under any circumstances give rise to any compensation.
You are responsible for checking and approving downloaded catalogues, and therefore for the accuracy and thoroughness of the information shown in the catalogue. All the information relating to the articles, the purchasing department and the company is automatically taken from the final approved version of a catalogue. Consequently, if there is incorrect information in the orders, e-Catalogue cannot be held responsible for any problem which arises.
You are responsible for monitoring and managing the orders you create in e-Catalogue, even if e-Catalogue sends out automatic notifications in certain cases. Failure to receive a notification or lack of information in the notification cannot under any circumstances give rise to any compensation.
 
If you plan to organise electronic reverse auctions, you can only do this if this falls within the field of application authorised by current legislation.
If you plan to organise electronic reverse auctions, first make contact with FPS P&O, the operator of this application, in order to deal with the applicability, configuration and planning of the auctions.
Subject to the communication issued by e-Auctions even to participants you have selected, you are expected to have provided these participants with adequate information in the publication, the contractual documents and the annex to the call for bids.
You are expected to supervise an auction while it is taking place and, if necessary, stop it subject to your own responsibility.
 
Use of Cookies
 
This internet site uses ""cookies"" which are small text files or data placed on your computer by the browser. These cookies are used for a variety of purposes:
 
• For example a technical cookie stores preferences on the subject of language.
• A session cookie is a temporary cookie allowing you to navigate between the various applications without having to connect up again.
• A tracking cookie keeps track of your surfing behaviour on the website and allows for personalized visualisation of websites.

B. Your private life
 
FPS P&O respects the private life of users. Although most of the information on this site is available without needing to supply any data of a personal nature, the user may be asked to provide personal information. In this case, the data is treated in accordance with the provisions of the law of 8 December 1992 relating to processing data of a personal nature.
 
More specifically, in concrete terms, this means that:
 
The person in charge of processing data of a personal nature is:
 
FPS Personnel and Organisation
Head of e-Procurement department
Rue de la Loi 51
1040 Bruxelles [Brussels]
e.proc@publicprocurement.be
+ 32 2 7905200
 
 
• Data of a personal nature is collected and processed in order to ensure that the e-Procurement applications operate in a satisfactory way (for example so that the information you require can be supplied and so that you can be kept informed about any information relating to the operations of the e-Procurement applications. Concrete examples: receiving messaging on the basis of your search profile, receiving an acknowledgement of receipt for submitting a bid, etc.).
• You still have access to your data and you can check its accuracy, continuing to have mistakes in your personal data corrected at no expense.
• FPS P&O undertakes not to use the data processed for marketing purposes and to apply the best possible safety measures in order to prevent any misuse by third parties of the personal data you have supplied.
 
For how long do we keep your personal data?
 
• If you are registered as a company, you must connect up to user Management at least once a year. If you do not, your data will then be deleted one year after the last time you were connected.
• If you are registered as a purchaser with a contracting authority, your data is not deleted automatically. Deletion can only take place after an email has been sent to the helpdesk at the following address: e.proc@publicprocurement.be.
 
 
C. Disclaimer
 
General information
 
FPS P&O makes every possible effort to ensure that the information made available is complete, correct, thorough and up-to-date. In spite of these efforts, this information may contain mistakes. If the information circulated contains mistakes or if some information is unavailable, every possible step will be taken in order to rectify the situation as quickly as possible. Should you note any mistakes in the information made available, you can always contact FPS P&O (see below).
 
FPS P&O makes every effort and uses all reasonable means to ensure that the web site is secure, limiting as far as possible any disruption due to technical problems. FPS P&O cannot however exclude the possibility of malicious, unauthorised or problematic technical manœuvres or interventions occurring. This is why FPS P&O cannot guarantee continuous access to the web site or that these problems will not disrupt it in any other way. Use of the web site is carried out exclusively at the risks of the user.
 
Any technical problem that you encounter must be documented (what action you have performed, screen and/or video shots, exact error messages, etc.) and indicated within 60 minutes to FPS P&O at the following electronic address or telephone number: e.proc@publicprocurement.be - +32 2 790 52 00.
The fact of not indicating (in time) a technical problem is considered to be a waiver of any claim for potential and future damages in this regard.
 
Some modules on our web sites depend on external software (Java, Fedict software, Adobe and so on). If one or several of these components has been changed  unexpectedly by these suppliers of external software, FPS P&O cannot guarantee the satisfactory operation of its own sites. FPS P&O undertakes to offer a solution as quickly as possible.
For satisfactory use of our sites, you must regularly update your software, in particular:
 
- the operating software (operating system or OS)
- the browser
- the version of Java
- (for purchasers): the eID software
- the software for reading pdf files
 
Faced with the complexity of the interaction between the browser, Java, OS, etc., our department has drawn up a table which provides details about the software combinations successfully tested by FPS P&O.
It goes without saying that combinations which are not supported can lead to certain functions within the applications failing to operate. FPS P&O is not able to help you with this.
The table can be consulted on: http://www.publicprocurement.be/fr/documents/e-procurement-specifications
 
In addition, FPS P&O reserves the right to terminate access to the site (fully or partially), every day between 11 pm and 4 am (CET) in order to carry out maintenance work on the application. Any other stoppage period shall be notified on the home page of the https://my.publicprocurement.be site under the heading Information System and for e-Tendering in particular on http://www.publicprocurement.be/fr/unavailabilities.
 
However FPS P&O cannot under any circumstances be held responsible for direct or indirect damage resulting from using this web site or the information made available therein. The user is personally responsible for any damage caused to its computer system or resulting from a loss of data subsequent to downloading information. The user is also personally responsible for any failure to submit bids or for submitting them after the deadline.
 
Although FPS P&O undertakes to analyse the questions submitted or the problems encountered by users within a reasonable period of time and to propose an appropriate solution, the service does not guarantee that it can offer a correct solution for each problem posed (whether or not associated with the application).
From experience, our service can confirm that most of the notifications not associated with the application are due to the configuration of the computer used. Problems with configuration are often associated with one of the following fields:
 
• Java Software 
• Browser parameters
• Network parameters
• Security parameters
• Middleware parameters
 
Depending on the cause of the problem, analysis may take a certain amount of time and numerous operations may prove necessary in order to configure the computer correctly.
Consequently our service advises each user to configure the computer in question well in advance (over 5 working days) and to test the configuration.
If a problem with use is notified under 2 hours before opening the file and if the cause of the problem lies with the user (because of incorrect local configuration, faulty use, etc.) FPS P&O cannot guarantee that it will be able to identify a solution before opening time. Depending on the reason, numerous operations may in fact prove necessary.
 
The above exclusions from liability are valid both before the submission deadline and after the submission deadline. All changes in the requests for participation / bids subsequent to the deadline are made at the user’s own risk.
At the time of opening the bids, the application shall be rendered unusable without any prior warning. Consequently, a user who is still working at that point will be considered to have submitted the last recorded version of the request for participation / bid, and not to have submitted a request for participation / bid if no prior recorded version is available.
 
Our disclaimer relating to the application:
 
User management
 
Requests to join an organisation or operations on a profile are approved by a superuser (person appointed within your organisation).
FPS P&O cannot under any circumstances be held responsible for any late approval, or for the consequences of this.
In addition, FPS P&O is not responsible for checking the roles people occupy. Indeed our service cannot evaluate the job a worker carries out within an organisation.
Finally: FPS P&O cannot be held responsible for the accuracy of data supplied by a user in user Management.
 
e-Notification
 
FPS P&O is not liable, except with regard to its own publications, for the content of the contract notice, contractual documents, the content of a forum, the written record of the opening of the tenders and any other notification made by the awarding authority. In the event of any inaccuracy, gap, imprecision, etc., you must contact the awarding authority directly.
As part of the principle for the transparency of public procurement contracts, our service cannot delete the contract notice or published contractual documents.
 
e-Tendering
 
FPS P&O is not liable for the files downloaded by users. The damage caused by corrupted files must be recovered from the user who has downloaded these files.
As indicated in the conditions for use, as purchaser you must have downloaded the bids received yourself onto a secure server prior to archiving date.

Preamble
The Open Database License (ODbL) is a license agreement intended to
allow users to freely share, modify, and use this Database while
maintaining this same freedom for others. Many databases are covered by
copyright, and therefore this document licenses these rights. Some
jurisdictions, mainly in the European Union, have specific rights that
cover databases, and so the ODbL addresses these rights, too. Finally,
the ODbL is also an agreement in contract for users of this Database to
act in certain ways in return for accessing this Database.

Databases can contain a wide variety of types of content (images,
audiovisual material, and sounds all in the same database, for example),
and so the ODbL only governs the rights over the Database, and not the
contents of the Database individually. Licensors should use the ODbL
together with another license for the contents, if the contents have a
single set of rights that uniformly covers all of the contents. If the
contents have multiple sets of different rights, Licensors should
describe what rights govern what contents together in the individual
record or in some other way that clarifies what rights apply.

Sometimes the contents of a database, or the database itself, can be
covered by other rights not addressed here (such as private contracts,
trade mark over the name, or privacy rights / data protection rights
over information in the contents), and so you are advised that you may
have to consult other documents or clear other rights before doing
activities not covered by this License.

The Licensor (as defined below)

and

You (as defined below)

agree as follows:

or the Database as part of a Collective Database in any way that enables
a Person to make or receive copies of the Database or a Derivative
Database. Conveying does not include interaction with a user through a
computer network, or creating and Using a Produced Work, where no
transfer of a copy of the Database or a Derivative Database occurs.
“Contents” – The contents of this Database, which includes the
information, independent works, or other material collected into the
Database. For example, the contents of the Database could be factual
data or works such as images, audiovisual material, text, or sounds.

“Database” – A collection of material (the Contents) arranged in a
systematic or methodical way and individually accessible by electronic
or other means offered under the terms of this License.

“Database Directive” – Means Directive 96/9/EC of the European

generis”) rights in the Database Directive (as amended and as transposed

other alteration of the Database or of a Substantial part of the
Contents. This includes, but is not limited to, Extracting or
Re-utilising the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents in a new
Database.

“Extraction” – Means the permanent or temporary transfer of all or a
Substantial part of the Contents to another medium by any means or in
any form.

“License” – Means this license agreement and is both a license of rights
such as copyright and Database Rights and an agreement in contract.

“Licensor” – Means the Person that offers the Database under the terms
of this License.

“Person” – Means a natural or legal person or a body of persons
corporate or incorporate.

“Produced Work” – a work (such as an image, audiovisual material, text,

Database, or this Database as part of a Collective Database.

“Publicly” – means to Persons other than You or under Your control by
either more than 50% ownership or by the power to direct their
activities (such as contracting with an independent consultant).

“Re-utilisation” – means any form of making available to the public all
or a Substantial part of the Contents by the distribution of copies, by
renting, by online or other forms of transmission.

“Substantial” – Means substantial in terms of quantity or quality or a
combination of both. The repeated and systematic Extraction or
Re-utilisation of insubstantial parts of the Contents may amount to the
Extraction or Re-utilisation of a Substantial part of the Contents.

“Use” – As a verb, means doing any act that is restricted by copyright
or Database Rights whether in the original medium or any other; and
includes without limitation distributing, copying, publicly performing,
publicly displaying, and preparing derivative works of the Database, as
well as modifying the Database as may be technically necessary to use it
in a different mode or format.

“You” – Means a Person exercising rights under this License who has not
previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the
Database, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to
exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.

2.0 What this License covers
2.1. Legal effect of this document. This License is:

      a. A license of applicable copyright and neighbouring rights;

      b. A license of the Database Right; and

      c. An agreement in contract between You and the Licensor.

2.2 Legal rights covered. This License covers the legal rights in the
Database, including:

      a. Copyright. Any copyright or neighbouring rights in the Database.
The copyright licensed includes any individual elements of the
Database, but does not cover the copyright over the Contents
independent of this Database. See Section 2.4 for details. Copyright
law varies between jurisdictions, but is likely to cover: the Database
model or schema, which is the structure, arrangement, and organisation
of the Database, and can also include the Database tables and table
indexes; the data entry and output sheets; and the Field names of
Contents stored in the Database;

      b. Database Rights. Database Rights only extend to the Extraction and
Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents.
Database Rights can apply even when there is no copyright over the
      Database. Database Rights can also apply when the Contents are removed
from the Database and are selected and arranged in a way that would
not infringe any applicable copyright; and

      c. Contract. This is an agreement between You and the Licensor for
access to the Database. In return you agree to certain conditions of
use on this access as outlined in this License.

2.3 Rights not covered.

      a. This License does not apply to computer programs used in the making
or operation of the Database;

      b. This License does not cover any patents over the Contents or the
Database; and

      c. This License does not cover any trademarks associated with the
      Database.

2.4 Relationship to Contents in the Database. The individual items of
the Contents contained in this Database may be covered by other rights,
including copyright, patent, data protection, privacy, or personality
rights, and this License does not cover any rights (other than Database
Rights or in contract) in individual Contents contained in the Database.
For example, if used on a Database of images (the Contents), this
License would not apply to copyright over individual images, which could
have their own separate licenses, or one single license covering all of
the rights over the images.

3.0 Rights granted
3.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the Licensor
grants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, terminable (but
only under Section 9) license to Use the Database for the duration of
any applicable copyright and Database Rights. These rights explicitly
include commercial use, and do not exclude any field of endeavour. To
the extent possible in the relevant jurisdiction, these rights may be
exercised in all media and formats whether now known or created in the
future.

The rights granted cover, for example:

      a. Extraction and Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of
the Contents;

      b. Creation of Derivative Databases;

      c. Creation of Collective Databases;

      d. Creation of temporary or permanent reproductions by any means and
in any form, in whole or in part, including of any Derivative
Databases or as a part of Collective Databases; and

      e. Distribution, communication, display, lending, making available, or
performance to the public by any means and in any form, in whole or in
part, including of any Derivative Database or as a part of Collective
      Databases.

3.2 Compulsory license schemes. For the avoidance of doubt:

      a. Non-waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in
which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves
the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You
of the rights granted under this License;

      b. Waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in
which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the
exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of
the rights granted under this License; and,

      c. Voluntary license schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect
royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is
a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing
schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights
granted under this License.

3.3 The right to release the Database under different terms, or to stop
distributing or making available the Database, is reserved. Note that
this Database may be multiple-licensed, and so You may have the choice
of using alternative licenses for this Database. Subject to Section
10.4, all other rights not expressly granted by Licensor are reserved.

4.0 Conditions of Use
4.1 The rights granted in Section 3 above are expressly made subject to
Your complying with the following conditions of use. These are important
conditions of this License, and if You fail to follow them, You will be
in material breach of its terms.

4.2 Notices. If You Publicly Convey this Database, any Derivative
Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, then You
must:

      a. Do so only under the terms of this License or another license
permitted under Section 4.4;

      b. Include a copy of this License (or, as applicable, a license
permitted under Section 4.4) or its Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
with the Database or Derivative Database, including both in the
Database or Derivative Database and in any relevant documentation; and

      c. Keep intact any copyright or Database Right notices and notices
that refer to this License.

      d. If it is not possible to put the required notices in a particular
file due to its structure, then You must include the notices in a
location (such as a relevant directory) where users would be likely to
look for it.

4.3 Notice for using output (Contents). Creating and Using a Produced
Work does not require the notice in Section 4.2. However, if you
Publicly Use a Produced Work, You must include a notice associated with
the Produced Work reasonably calculated to make any Person that uses,
views, accesses, interacts with, or is otherwise exposed to the Produced
Work aware that Content was obtained from the Database, Derivative
Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, and that it
is available under this License.

      a. Example notice. The following text will satisfy notice under
Section 4.3:

    Contains information from DATABASE NAME, which is made available
    here under the Open Database License (ODbL).
DATABASE NAME should be replaced with the name of the Database and a
hyperlink to the URI of the Database. “Open Database License” should
contain a hyperlink to the URI of the text of this License. If
hyperlinks are not possible, You should include the plain text of the
required URI’s with the above notice.

4.4 Share alike.

      a. Any Derivative Database that You Publicly Use must be only under
the terms of:

           i. This License;

           ii. A later version of this License similar in spirit to this
License; or

           iii. A compatible license.

If You license the Derivative Database under one of the licenses
mentioned in (iii), You must comply with the terms of that license.

      b. For the avoidance of doubt, Extraction or Re-utilisation of the
whole or a Substantial part of the Contents into a new database is a
Derivative Database and must comply with Section 4.4.

      c. Derivative Databases and Produced Works. A Derivative Database is
Publicly Used and so must comply with Section 4.4. if a Produced Work
created from the Derivative Database is Publicly Used.

      d. Share Alike and additional Contents. For the avoidance of doubt,
You must not add Contents to Derivative Databases under Section 4.4 a
that are incompatible with the rights granted under this License.

      e. Compatible licenses. Licensors may authorise a proxy to determine
compatible licenses under Section 4.4 a iii. If they do so, the
authorised proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a compatible
license grants You permission to use the compatible license.

4.5 Limits of Share Alike. The requirements of Section 4.4 do not apply
in the following:

      a. For the avoidance of doubt, You are not required to license
Collective Databases under this License if You incorporate this
Database or a Derivative Database in the collection, but this License
still applies to this Database or a Derivative Database as a part of
the Collective Database;

      b. Using this Database, a Derivative Database, or this Database as
part of a Collective Database to create a Produced Work does not
create a Derivative Database for purposes of Section 4.4; and

      c. Use of a Derivative Database internally within an organisation is
not to the public and therefore does not fall under the requirements
of Section 4.4.

4.6 Access to Derivative Databases. If You Publicly Use a Derivative
Database or a Produced Work from a Derivative Database, You must also
offer to recipients of the Derivative Database or Produced Work a copy
in a machine readable form of:

      a. The entire Derivative Database; or

      b. A file containing all of the alterations made to the Database or
the method of making the alterations to the Database (such as an
algorithm), including any additional Contents, that make up all the
differences between the Database and the Derivative Database.

The Derivative Database (under a.) or alteration file (under b.) must be
available at no more than a reasonable production cost for physical
distributions and free of charge if distributed over the internet.

4.7 Technological measures and additional terms

      a. This License does not allow You to impose (except subject to
Section 4.7 b.) any terms or any technological measures on the
Database, a Derivative Database, or the whole or a Substantial part of
the Contents that alter or restrict the terms of this License, or any
rights granted under it, or have the effect or intent of restricting
the ability of any person to exercise those rights.

      b. Parallel distribution. You may impose terms or technological
measures on the Database, a Derivative Database, or the whole or a
Substantial part of the Contents (a “Restricted Database”) in
contravention of Section 4.74 a. only if You also make a copy of the
Database or a Derivative Database available to the recipient of the
Restricted Database:

           i. That is available without additional fee;

           ii. That is available in a medium that does not alter or restrict
the terms of this License, or any rights granted under it, or have
the effect or intent of restricting the ability of any person to
exercise those rights (an “Unrestricted Database”); and

           iii. The Unrestricted Database is at least as accessible to the
recipient as a practical matter as the Restricted Database.

      c. For the avoidance of doubt, You may place this Database or a
Derivative Database in an authenticated environment, behind a
password, or within a similar access control scheme provided that You
do not alter or restrict the terms of this License or any rights
granted under it or have the effect or intent of restricting the
ability of any person to exercise those rights.

4.8 Licensing of others. You may not sublicense the Database. Each time
You communicate the Database, the whole or Substantial part of the
Contents, or any Derivative Database to anyone else in any way, the
Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Database on the same
terms and conditions as this License. You are not responsible for
enforcing compliance by third parties with this License, but You may
enforce any rights that You have over a Derivative Database. You are
solely responsible for any modifications of a Derivative Database made
by You or another Person at Your direction. You may not impose any
further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed
under this License.

5.0 Moral rights
5.1 Moral rights. This section covers moral rights, including any rights
to be identified as the author of the Database or to object to treatment
that would otherwise prejudice the author’s honour and reputation, or
any other derogatory treatment:

      a. For jurisdictions allowing waiver of moral rights, Licensor waives
all moral rights that Licensor may have in the Database to the fullest
extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section
      10.4;

      b. If waiver of moral rights under Section 5.1 a in the relevant
jurisdiction is not possible, Licensor agrees not to assert any moral
rights over the Database and waives all claims in moral rights to the
fullest extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under
Section 10.4; and

      c. For jurisdictions not allowing waiver or an agreement not to assert
moral rights under Section 5.1 a and b, the author may retain their
moral rights over certain aspects of the Database.

Please note that some jurisdictions do not allow for the waiver of moral
rights, and so moral rights may still subsist over the Database in some
jurisdictions.

6.0 Fair dealing, Database exceptions, and other rights not affected
6.1 This License does not affect any rights that You or anyone else may
independently have under any applicable law to make any use of this
Database, including without limitation:

      a. Exceptions to the Database Right including: Extraction of Contents
from non-electronic Databases for private purposes, Extraction for
purposes of illustration for teaching or scientific research, and
Extraction or Re-utilisation for public security or an administrative
or judicial procedure.

      b. Fair dealing, fair use, or any other legally recognised limitation
or exception to infringement of copyright or other applicable laws.

6.2 This License does not affect any rights of lawful users to Extract
and Re-utilise insubstantial parts of the Contents, evaluated
quantitatively or qualitatively, for any purposes whatsoever, including
creating a Derivative Database (subject to other rights over the
Contents, see Section 2.4). The repeated and systematic Extraction or
Re-utilisation of insubstantial parts of the Contents may however amount
to the Extraction or Re-utilisation of a Substantial part of the
Contents.

7.0 Warranties and Disclaimer
7.1 The Database is licensed by the Licensor “as is” and without any
warranty of any kind, either express, implied, or arising by statute,
custom, course of dealing, or trade usage. Licensor specifically
disclaims any and all implied warranties or conditions of title,
non-infringement, accuracy or completeness, the presence or absence of
errors, fitness for a particular purpose, merchantability, or otherwise.
Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so
this exclusion may not apply to You.

8.0 Limitation of liability
8.1 Subject to any liability that may not be excluded or limited by law,
the Licensor is not liable for, and expressly excludes, all liability
for loss or damage however and whenever caused to anyone by any use
under this License, whether by You or by anyone else, and whether caused
by any fault on the part of the Licensor or not. This exclusion of
liability includes, but is not limited to, any special, incidental,
consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages such as loss of revenue,
data, anticipated profits, and lost business. This exclusion applies
even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such
damages.

8.2 If liability may not be excluded by law, it is limited to actual and
direct financial loss to the extent it is caused by proved negligence on
the part of the Licensor.

9.0 Termination of Your rights under this License
9.1 Any breach by You of the terms and conditions of this License
automatically terminates this License with immediate effect and without
notice to You. For the avoidance of doubt, Persons who have received the
Database, the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents, Derivative
Databases, or the Database as part of a Collective Database from You
under this License will not have their licenses terminated provided
their use is in full compliance with this License or a license granted
under Section 4.8 of this License. Sections 1, 2, 7, 8, 9 and 10 will
survive any termination of this License.

9.2 If You are not in breach of the terms of this License, the Licensor
will not terminate Your rights under it.

9.3 Unless terminated under Section 9.1, this License is granted to You
for the duration of applicable rights in the Database.

9.4 Reinstatement of rights. If you cease any breach of the terms and
conditions of this License, then your full rights under this License
will be reinstated:

      a. Provisionally and subject to permanent termination until the 60th
day after cessation of breach;

      b. Permanently on the 60th day after cessation of breach unless
otherwise reasonably notified by the Licensor; or

      c. Permanently if reasonably notified by the Licensor of the
violation, this is the first time You have received notice of
violation of this License from the Licensor, and You cure the
violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

Persons subject to permanent termination of rights are not eligible to
be a recipient and receive a license under Section 4.8.

9.5 Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release
the Database under different license terms or to stop distributing or
making available the Database. Releasing the Database under different
license terms or stopping the distribution of the Database will not
withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is
required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as
stated above.

10.0 General
10.1 If any provision of this License is held to be invalid or
unenforceable, that must not affect the validity or enforceability of
the remainder of the terms and conditions of this License and each
remaining provision of this License shall be valid and enforced to the
fullest extent permitted by law.

10.2 This License is the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the rights granted here over the Database. It replaces any
earlier understandings, agreements or representations with respect to
the Database.

10.3 If You are in breach of the terms of this License, You will not be
entitled to rely on the terms of this License or to complain of any
breach by the Licensor.

10.4 Choice of law. This License takes effect in and will be governed by
the laws of the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are
sought to be enforced. If the standard suite of rights granted under
applicable copyright law and Database Rights in the relevant
jurisdiction includes additional rights not granted under this License,
these additional rights are granted in this License in order to meet the
terms of this License.",,

about the open lIcence
Etalab is the task force under the French Prime Minister’s authority leading Open Government Data policy for France. Etalab introduces the Open Licence to facilitate and encourage easy reuse of public sector information – as de ned by French Law – free of charge and as broadly as possible,
Within the scope of their public service missions, public sector bodies produce and receive public sector information, which may be re-used by any natural or legal person.
Under the terms of French Law, are not considered public sector information : information the communication of which is not a right under information access legislation ; information contained in documents produced
or received by public sector bodies exercising a public service of industrial or commercial character ;
and information contained in documents over which third parties hold intellectual property rights,
Information which contains personal data is not considered to be public sector information re-usable under
the terms of French Law – except where persons on which data is collected have agreed to its reuse, where
this data has been rendered anonymous by the public sector bodies, or where a legal or statutory provision permits its re-use (in these three cases, re-use is subject to compliance with French privacy protection legislation).
This licence is version 1.0 of the Open Licence. Etalab may, from time to time, offer new versions
of the Open Licence. However, re-users may continue to re-use information available under this licence if they wish to do so.",,

http://data.norge.no/nlod,Norway,budget,,,Norwegian License for Open Government Data (NLOD) 2.0,Bespoke,?,No,"OGL 1.0, 2.0,3.0; CC BY NO 3.0; CC BY 4.0; ODC BY ",,"Preface of licence
This licence grants you the right to copy, use and distribute information, provided you acknowledge the contributors and comply with the terms and conditions stipulated in this licence. By using information made available under this licence, you accept the terms and conditions set forth in this licence. As set out in Section 7, the licensor disclaims any and all liability for the quality of the information and what the information is used for.

This licence shall not impose any limitations on the rights or freedoms of the licensee under the Norwegian Freedom of Information Act or any other legislation granting the general public a right of access to public sector information, or that follow from exemptions or limitations stipulated in the Norwegian Copyright Act. Further, the licence shall not impose any limitations on the licensee's freedom of expression recognized by law.

Comments:
The first sentence provides a brief introduction to the licence and points out key rights and obligations. The licence is primarily intended for use when public entities distribute data and other relevant content for further use by business and industry as well as civilian society.

The other sentence describes how the licence agreement is entered into. Use of copyrighted information requires a licence (a permit). Such a licence is granted when you enter into the licence agreement by using the information and thus become a licensee.

The third paragraph emphasises that the licence shall not deprive the licensee of any rights and freedoms pursuant to law. The intention behind the licence is to grant the licensee rights that he or she otherwise would not have, not to deprive the licensee of rights.

The terms and conditions stipulated in the licence are based on the assumption that the information thus distributed is protected under the Copyright Act or other legislation. If the information is exempt from copyright protection, e.g. under Section 9 of the Copyright Act, everyone is at liberty to freely use the information without having to comply with the terms and conditions set out in this licence.

This licence addresses the right to use information. It does not address access to information or terms of delivery.

1. Definitions
«Database» shall mean a database or similar protected under Section 43 of the Norwegian Copyright Act.
«Information» shall mean texts, images, recordings, data sets or other works protected under Section 1 of the Norwegian Copyright Act, or which are protected under provisions addressing what is referred to as «neighbouring rights» in Chapter 5 of the Norwegian Copyright Act (including databases and photographs), and which are distributed under this licence.
«Copy» shall mean reproduction in any form.
«Licensee» and «you» shall mean natural or legal persons using information under this licence.
«Licensor» shall mean the natural or legal person that makes information available under this licence.
«Distribute» shall mean any actions whereby information is made available, including to distribute, transfer, communicate, disperse, show, perform, sell, lend and rent.
«Use» shall mean one or more actions relevant to copyright law requiring permission from the owner of the copyright.
Comments:
Section 1 has various definitions used below in the licence. The defined term is indicated in bold. In the agreement, the term information is used as a generic term for everything offered for use under the licence. This may comprise various types of works such as copyrighted works (for example articles, novels, creative photographs, illustrations, etc.) as well as protected databases, tables, sound recordings, films, regular photographs, recordings of performances by performing artists, etc. The wording is general enough to cover computer programmes, but it is recommended that free licences adapted especially for computer programmes be used for these.

Because the licence will primarily be used for Open Government data, the word «data» has been used in the title of the licence. Thus, «Open Government data» must be understood to constitute a type of «information». The licence can, however, also be used for licensing of other types of information. As a consequence, the term « Open Government data» has been used only in the title, while the term «Information» is used in the licence itself.

In colloquial terms, the word «database» can also be used for certain types of catalogues which are protected as copyrighted works under Section 2 of the Copyright Act. The databases covered under Section 2 are covered by the definition of information. For such «databases», the Creative Commons licences will be compatible in accordance with Section 9 of this licence.

2. Licence
The licensee, subject to the limitations that follow from this licence, may use the information for any purpose and in all contexts, by:

copying the information and distributing the information to others,
modifying the information and/or combining the information with other information, and
copying and distributing such changed or combined information.
This is a non-exclusive, free, perpetual and worldwide licence. The information may be used in any medium and format known today and/or which will become known in the future. The Licensee shall not sub-license or transfer this licence.

Comments:
In Section 2 the licensee is granted a very extensive and liberal right to use the information. The licensee may share the information with others, change the information and use the information in the way he or she wants to. The only exception is if the licensor is not entitled to license the information under this licence; i.e. a mistake has been made. Please refer to Section 3 for further details.

In the last sentence it is specified that the licensee is not entitled to sub-license or transfer this licence. This entails that this licence does not grant the licensee permission to grant others permission to use the information. The licensee does not have permission to change the terms and conditions for use of the information. Although the licensee has the right to transfer the information under this licence, the party receiving such information must obtain permission from the original licensor to be able to use the information. In practice, this means that the terms and conditions of this licence apply regardless of whom you receive the information from.

3. Exemptions
The licence does not apply to and therefore does not grant a right to use:

information which contains personal data covered by the Norwegian Personal Data Act unless there is a legitimate basis for the disclosure and further processing of the personal data
information distributed in violation of a statutory obligation to observe confidentiality
information excluded from public disclosure pursuant to law, including information deemed sensitive under the Norwegian National Security Act
information subject to third party rights which the licensor is not authorised to license to the licensee
information protected by intellectual property rights other than copyright and neighbouring rights in accordance with Chapter 5 of the Norwegian Copyright Act, such as trademarks, patents and design rights, but this does not entail an impediment to use information where the licensor's logo has been permanently integrated into the information or to attribute the origin of the information in accordance with the article below relating to attribution.
If the licensor has made available information not covered by the licence according to the above list, the licensee must cease all use of the information under the licence, and erase the information as soon as he or she becomes aware of or should have understood that the information is not covered by the licence.

Comments:
This licence is to be used for information which can be re-used. It shall not and cannot be used for information exempt from public disclosure in any way. If such information has been distributed under this licence, it will be because a mistake has been made. The licence does not apply for information of this type. Thus, it is not permissible to use this type of information by virtue of the licence.

The licensee must be able to assume that the licensor has made a pre-assessment of whether the information can be distributed or not. However, it must be possible to hold the licensee responsible for distributing the information if the licensee should have understood that the information was distributed by mistake.

Publication of «information subject to third party rights which the licensor is not authorised to license to the licensee» entails that the licensor is not the owner of the copyright to the information and that he has not been granted a sufficient licence from the owner of the copyright.

4. Effects of breach of the licence
The licence is subject to the licensee's compliance with the terms and conditions of this licence. In the event that the licensee commits a breach of this licence, this will entail that the licensee's right to use the information will be revoked immediately without further notice. In case of such a breach, the licensee must immediately and without further notice take measures to cause the infringement to end. Because the right to use the information has been terminated, the licensee must cease all use of the information by virtue of the licence.

Comments:
If the licensee does not fulfil the obligations under the licence agreement, the permit to use the information is revoked. The licensee must then cease to share and use the information. However, parties having received information from a party in breach of the licence may continue to use the information as long as their use is in conformity with the licence agreement.

5. Attribution
The licensee shall attribute the licensor as specified by the licensor and include a reference to this licence. To the extent practically possible, the licensee shall provide a link to both this licence and the source of the information.

If the licensor has not specified how attributions shall be made, the licensee shall normally state the following: «Contains data under the Norwegian licence for Open Government data (NLOD) distributed by [name of licensor]».

If the licensor has specified that the information shall only be available under a specific version of this licence, cf. Section 10, the licensee shall also state this.

If the information has been changed, the licensee must clearly indicate that changes have been made by the licensee.

Comments:
This provision stipulates that the licensee must state the source of the information, and that this must be stated as specified in the licence if the licensor has not specified otherwise.

The provision that it must be «practically possible» to provide a link to this licence and to the source of the information entails, for example, that the licensee need not provide a link when the information is not distributed in an electronic format.

Thus, the licence requires an attribution statement, and describes how this is to be implemented, but it does not specify where this attribution statement must be positioned. This entails that the attribution statement need not be placed on the same page as the information, as it is sufficient that the reference to the source be placed on an «About» page, etc. It is also not a requirement that each individual data element be listed. Such a requirement would have rendered it difficult to comply with the attribution requirement in cases where data from several different sources are presented on a map, for example. The sources may instead be stated below the map, on an «About» page, etc. However, the reference to the source must not be hidden or difficult to find.

If the licensee has changed the information, this must be indicated, for example in this manner: «Contains data under the Norwegian licence for Open Government Data (NLOD) distributed by [name of licensor]. Nils Klim has changed the information by cross-cutting it with user-generated content.»

6. Proper use
The licensee shall not use the information in a manner that appears misleading nor present the information in a distorted or incorrect manner.

Neither the licensor's nor other contributors' names or trademarks must be used to support, recommend or market the licensee or any products or services using the information.

Comments:
This provision addresses the fact that the licensee must use the information in a prudent manner. The information cannot be changed, for example, and then be presented as if it has not been changed. The requirement that the information not be presented in an incorrect manner, entails that the licensee must familiarize himself with how to correctly interpret and understand the information. If the data is misunderstood and/or used incorrectly, any incorrect elements must be remedied as soon as one becomes aware of or should have understood that the information has been presented in an incorrect manner.

This provision must also be viewed in the context of existing regulations relating to misleading marketing, deception, etc.

7. Disclaimer of liability
The information is licensed «as is». The information may contain errors and omissions. The licensor provides no warranties, including relating to the content and relevance of the information.

The licensor disclaims any liability for errors and defects associated with the information to the maximum extent permitted by law.

The licensor shall not be liable for direct or indirect losses as a result of use of the information or in connection with copying or further distribution of the information.

Comments:
This provision addresses the fact that the licensor assumes no economic liability for the information. This entails, inter alia, that the licensor does not assume liability for the correctness or completeness of the information.

The licensor also does not assume liability for how the information is used or for the consequences of any use.

As the licence agreement does not address access to the information, the licensor also does not assume liability for the information being accessible. This provision has a wide scope and also applies to situations not listed here.

8. Guarantees regarding data quality and accessibility
This licence does not prevent the licensor from issuing supplementary statements regarding expected or intended data quality and accessibility. Such statements shall be regarded as indicative in nature and not binding on the part of the licensor. The disclaimers in Section 7 also apply in full for such indicative statements. Based on separate agreement, the licensor may provide guarantees and distribute the information on terms and conditions different from those set forth in this licence.

Comments:
It follows from Section 8 that the licensor may provide supplementary statements regarding expected or intended data quality and accessibility. Such statements are indicative in nature and not binding for the licensor. They may be statements such as the following: «The information is normally updated at least once a month. We intend for the information to be accessible until 27 May 2664. We normally have an uptime of 99% measured in minutes per calendar month.»

If the licensee would like the licensor to warrant e.g. data quality and accessibility, such warranties must be made in a separate agreement between the licensor and the licensee.

9. Licence compatibility
If the licensee is to distribute an adapted or combined work based on information covered by this licence and some other work licensed under a licence compatible by contract, such distribution may be based on an appropriate licence compatible by contract, cf. the list below.

A licence compatible by contract shall mean the following licences:

for all information: Open Government Licence (version 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0), Creative Commons Attribution Licence (international version 4.0 and norwegian version 4.0),
for those parts of the information which do not constitute databases: Creative Commons Attribution Licence (generic version 1.0, 2.0, 2.5 and unported version 3.0) and Creative Commons Navngivelse 3.0 Norge,
for those parts of the information which constitute databases: Open Data Commons Attribution License (version 1.0).
This provision does not prevent other licences from being compatible with this licence based on their content.

Comments:
The purpose of this Section is to specify that information licensed under NLOD may be used together with information licensed under one of the licences listed. If a data set has been distributed under NLOD and another data set has been distributed under OGL or CC-BY 4.0, these may be combined and re-published under one of these licences.

Another example is if you use images covered by NLOD together with your own images and images under the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC-BY) in a collage. The entire collage may then be licensed under the CC-BY licence. In such a case, you must make sure to state the name of the licensor for the images originally licensed under NLOD, your own name, and the name of the licensor for the images under CC-BY as well as comply with the other licence terms and conditions.

This provision makes a distinction between rights linked to databases and other rights. If you distribute a database under a Creative Commons 3.0 licence, you may waive protection of the database, as it follows from Creative Commons (CC-BY 3.0 NO): «If the licensor has database rights or similar in pursuance of Section 43 of the (Norwegian) Copyright Act and EU’s Database Directive, the licensor waives these rights.» The licence is therefore not «compatible» with Creative Commons for databases per se. However, the licence agreement does not prevent the licensee from using individual elements / some content from the database. The provision on licence compatibility with Creative Commons may be applied for such elements.

10. New versions of the licence
The licensee may choose to use the information covered by this licence under any new versions of the Norwegian licence for Open Government data (NLOD) issued by the responsible ministry (currently the Ministry of Local Government and Modernisation) when these versions are final and official, unless the licensor when making the information available under this licence specifically has stated that solely version 2.0 of this licence may be used.

Comments:
The Ministry of Local Government and Modernisation (or any ministry which subsequently assumes this responsibility) may issue new versions of the licence, for example based on new experience, a desire to cover new needs or to ensure compatibility with new or other relevant licences.

The licensee is entitled, but not obligated, to use the information under any new licences issued, unless the licensor has made the reservation that the information will solely be available under version 2.0 of the licence.

If the licensor has stated that only a specific version of the licence is to be used, this must also be stated by the licensee. This can be done by stating, for example: «Contains data under the Norwegian licence for Open Government Data (NLOD) distributed by [name of licensor], licensed solely under version 2.0 of the licence.»

To ensure the information does not become «stranded» under old terms and conditions and thus become «abandoned data», such reservations should only be used when absolutely necessary.

11. Governing law and legal venue
This licence, including its formation, and any disputes and claims arising in connection with or relating to this licence, shall be regulated by Norwegian law. The legal venue shall be the licensor's ordinary legal venue. The licensor may, with regard to intellectual proprietary rights, choose to pursue a claim at other competent legal venues and/or based on the laws of the country where the intellectual property rights are sought enforced.

Comments:
As a point of departure, the licence agreement is subject to Norwegian law and legal proceedings must take place at the licensor's ordinary legal venue. For the Norwegian Government, this is Oslo District Court.

Lisens

Frembringelsen (definert nedenfor) tilbys i henhold til betingelsene i denne lisensen. Frembringelsen er beskyttet etter åndsverkloven og/eller annen gjeldende rett. Enhver bruk av frembringelsen ut over det som tillates av lisensen, følger av annen avtale med rettighetshaver eller følger av åndsverkloven eller dennes forskrifter, er forbudt.

Ved å benytte rettighetene til frembringelsen som følger av denne lisensen, aksepterer du å være bundet av lisensens vilkår. Ved dette gir lisensgiveren deg de rettigheter som her er beskrevet under den forutsetning at du godtar lisensens betingelser og vilkår. Ved mislighold av vilkårene i denne lisensen bortfaller alle rettigheter som er gitt deg gjennom denne lisensen.

1. Definisjoner

«Bearbeidelse» er et åndsverk som er avledet av eller bygger på et annet åndsverk i slik grad at opphavsretten til bearbeidelsen er avhengig av opphavsretten til det åndsverk som er bearbeidet. Eksempler kan være oversettelse av tekst, eller overføring av et åndsverk til en annen litterær eller kunstnerisk form som for eksempel dramatisering eller filmatisering av åndsverk, eller maleri eller fotografisk verk der motivet er et annet åndsverk. For å unngå tvil: For det tilfelle at frembringelsen er et musikkverk, en opptreden, eller et lydopptak, skal synkronisering («synching») med et filmverk, lysbildefremvisning, eller lignende, betraktes som en bearbeidelse i henhold til denne lisensen.
«Samling» betyr en samling av åndsverk, eller av andre typer frembringelser, der hver frembringelse er inkludert i sin helhet i umodifisert form sammen med ett eller flere andre bidrag, der hvert bidrag utgjør en separat og uavhengig frembringelse i seg selv, som er satt sammen til en kollektiv helhet. En samling vil ikke bli betraktet som en bearbeidelse (definert ovenfor) i henhold til denne lisensen.
«Tilgjengeliggjøre» betyr at eksemplar av frembringelsen eller bearbeidelse av frembringelsen, frembys for salg, utleie eller utlån, eller på annen måte spres til allmennheten.
«Lisensgiver» betyr det individ, de individer eller den eller de juridiske personer som tilbyr frembringelsen i henhold til vilkårene for denne lisensen.
«Originær rettighetshaver» betyr, dersom det gjelder åndsverk, det individ eller de individer som har skapt verket; dersom det gjelder andre frembringelser, den eller de individer eller juridiske personer som har skapt frembringelsen og som innehar nærstående rettigheter til frembringelsen i henhold til kap. 5 i åndsverkloven.
«Frembringelse» betyr det åndsverk som er beskyttet av åndsverkloven og som tilbys i henhold til denne lisensen. I tillegg til åndsverk, som definert av åndsverklovens § 1, omfattes også frembringelser som er beskyttet etter bestemmelsene om nærstående rettigheter (andre rettigheter) slik disse er definert etter åndsverksloven kapittel 5. Dette forutsetter at slike rettigheter er beskyttet av gjeldende lov i din jurisdiksjon.
«Du/deg» betyr et individ eller en juridisk person som utøver rettigheter i henhold til denne lisensen, som ikke tidligere har misligholdt vilkårene i denne lisensen i relasjon til frembringelsen, eller som har fått en uttrykkelig tillatelse fra lisensgiver til å utøve rettigheter i henhold til denne lisensen til tross for tidligere mislighold.
«Fremføre offentlig» betyr å tilgjengeliggjøre offentlig eller opptre offentlig med frembringelsen. Som offentlig fremføring regnes også kringkasting eller annen over­føring i tråd eller trådløst til allmennheten, herunder når frembringelsen stilles til rådighet på en slik måte at den enkelte selv kan velge tid og sted for tilgang til frembringelsen.
«Fremstille eksemplarer» betyr å fremstille varig eller midlertidig eksemplar av frembringelsen. Som fremstilling av eksemplar regnes også overføring til innretning som kan gjengi frembringelsen.
2. Låneregler og avgrensinger. Intet i lisensen har som formål å redusere eller begrense lovlig bruk etter gjeldende rett, herunder bruk med grunnlag i lånereglene i åndsverkloven kap. 2 (ÅVL §§ 11-38c).

3. Lisensrettigheter. Under vilkårene i denne lisens gir lisensgiver deg herved en global, vederlagsfri, ikke-eksklusiv og tidsubegrenset (i frembringelsens opphavsrettslige vernetid) rett til å utnytte de rettigheter som fremgår av følgende:

å fremstille eksemplarer av frembringelsen, å innarbeide frembringelsen i en eller flere samlinger og å fremstille eksemplarer av frembringelsen som en del av en samling;
å skape og fremstille eksemplarer av bearbeidelser av frembringelsen forutsatt at enhver slik bearbeidelse, inklusive enhver oversettelse i ethvert medium, tar rimelige skritt for klart å merke, markere eller på annen måte identifisere at endinger er gjort i forhold til den opprinnelige frembringelsen. For eksempel kan en oversettelse av et verk bli merket «Det opprinnelige verket er oversatt fra norsk til spansk,» eller en endring kan indikeres ved merket «Det opprinnelige verket er blitt endret.»;
å tilgjengeliggjøre og fremføre frembringelsen offentlig, herunder også frembringelser som er del av en samling; og,
å tilgjengeliggjøre og fremføre bearbeidelser offentlig.
For å unngå tvil:

Ikke-fraskrivbar tvangslisens. Lisensgiver bibeholder de eksklusive rettigheter til å hente ut vederlag for bruk («royalties») som følger av en lovbestemt eller obligatorisk lisensordning (tvangslisens) som man ikke kan fraskrive seg, som måtte oppstå gjennom handlinger som du foretar under utøvelse av de rettigheter som denne lisensen gir deg.
Fraskrivbar tvangslisens. Lisensgiver fraskriver seg de eksklusive rettigheter til å hente ut vederlag for bruk («royalties») som følger av en lovbestemt eller obligatorisk lisensordning (tvangslisens) som man kan fraskrive seg, som måtte oppstå gjennom handlinger som du foretar under utøvelse av de rettigheter som denne lisensen gir deg;
Avtalelisens og blankolisens. Lisensgiver fraskriver seg retten til å hente ut vederlag for bruk («royalties»), enten individuelt, eller gjennom en vederlagsorganisasjon eller utpekt agent som administrerer frivillige lisensordninger (avtalelisens), herunder blankolisensordninger, med hjemmel i §§ 36-47 i åndsverkloven (eller tilsvarende i en annen jurisdiksjon), fra handlinger du måtte foreta under utøvelse av de rettigheter som denne lisensen gir deg.
De ovennevnte rettigheter kan anvendes i alle kjente og fremtidige medier eller formater, enten de er kjent i dag eller senere anvist. De ovennevnte rettigheter inkluderer retten til å foreta slike modifikasjoner som er teknisk sett nødvendige for å utøve disse rettighetene i andre medier og formater. Alle de rettigheter som uttrykkelig ikke er gitt av lisensgiver er herved holdt tilbake. Dersom lisensgiver innehar databaserettigheter eller lignende i henhold til åndsverklovens § 43 og EUs databasedirektiv, fraskriver lisensgiver seg disse rettigheter.

4. Restriksjoner. Den lisensavtalen som følger av punkt 3 ovenfor er eksplisitt gitt under forutsetning av og begrenset av følgende restriksjoner:

Du kan kun tilgjengeliggjøre og fremføre frembringelsen offentlig når dette skjer under de vilkår som følger av denne lisensen. Du må vedlegge en kopi av, eller en nettadresse (URI, Uniform Resource Identifier) til, denne lisensen hver gang du tilgjengeliggjør eller fremfører frembringelsen offentlig. Du kan ikke tilby eller påby vilkår for frembringelsen, som endrer eller innskrenker lisensens vilkår eller mottakerne i å utøve de rettigheter som mottakeren har i henhold til lisensen. Du kan ikke gi underlisenser til frembringelsen. Du må sikre at alle henvisninger til lisensen og til ansvarsfraskrivelsen gis videre i uendret form når du tilgjengeliggjør eller fremfører frembringelsen offentlig. Når du tilgjengeliggjør eller fremfører frembringelsen offentlig, så kan du ikke utstyre frembringelsen med tekniske beskyttelsesmekanismer som begrenser mottaker i å utøve de rettigheter som følger av lisensen. Dette punkt 4(a) finner også anvendelse på frembringelsen, når frembringelsen er innarbeidet i en samling, men det er ikke et krav at samlingen, bortsett fra frembringelsen selv, skal være underlagt vilkårene i lisensen. Dersom du skaper en samling, og du mottar beskjed fra en lisensgiver om å slette fra samlingen en bestemt kreditering i henhold til punkt 4(b), så skal en slik beskjed etterkommes i den grad dette er praktisk mulig. Dersom du skaper en bearbeidelse, og du mottar beskjed fra en lisensgiver om å slette fra bearbeidelsen en bestemt kreditering i henhold til punkt 4(b), så skal en slik beskjed etterkommes i den grad dette er praktisk mulig.
Dersom du tilgjengeliggjør eller fremfører frembringelsen offentlig eller bearbeidelser av frembringelsen, eller samlinger der frembringelsen inngår, må du, så fremt et krav om sletting i henhold til punkt 4(a) ikke er blitt fremsatt, sikre at samtlige markeringer av opphavsrett («opphavsrettsnotiser») for frembringelsen bevares intakt. Dette betyr at du må sørge for, under hensyn til det medium og de midler du benytter: (i) å navngi originær rettighetshaver (eller pseudonym utpekt av originær rettighetshaver) slik god skikk tilsier, dersom dette er angitt, og/eller dersom originær rettighetshaver eller lisensgiver i opphavsrettsnotisen utpeker andre parter (f.eks. sponsorinstitusjoner, forlagsenheter, tidsskrifter) for navngivelse («parter som skal navngis»), også navngir disse; (ii) å oppgi navn eller tittel på frembringelsen, dersom dette er angitt; (iii) å oppgi, i den utstrekning det er praktisk mulig, den nettadressen (Uniform Resource Identifier, URI), dersom dette er angitt, som lisensgiver angir skal assosieres med frembringelsen, med mindre nettadressen ikke inneholder noen opphavsrettnotis; og, (iv) i tråd med punkt 3(b), dersom det er snakk om en bearbeidelse, å ta inn en kreditering som identifiserer frembringelsen som benyttes i bearbeidelsen (for eksempel «Fransk oversettelse av verk av originær rettighetshaver» eller «Filmmanuskript basert på verk av originær rettighetshaver»). Kreditering slik som påkrevd i dette punkt 4(b) skal skje i overensstemmelse med god skikk; forutsatt, imidlertid, at for bearbeidelser og samlinger skal kreditering gjøres på minst like vilkår som andre sammenlignbare og eksisterende krediteringer, slik at dersom alle bidragsytere til bearbeidelsen og samlingen krediteres, skal kreditering gjøres som en del av denne krediteringen og minst like fremtredende som krediteringen av andre bidragsytere. For å unngå tvil: Du kan bare bruke den kreditering som kreves i henhold til dette punkt 4(d) for det formål å navngi på den måten som er angitt ovenfor og, ved å utøve dine rettigheter i følge denne lisensen, så kan du verken implisitt eller eksplisitt fastslå eller implisere noen form for forbindelse med, sponsorskap, aksept eller godkjennelse fra originær rettighetshaver, lisensgiver og/eller andre som navngis, uten på forhånd å ha innhentet en separat, uttrykkelig skriftlig tillatelse til dette fra originær rettighetshaver, lisensgiver og/eller andre som navngis.
For å unngå tvil: De restriksjoner som nevnes ovenfor i punkt 4(a) og 4(b) gjelder ikke for de delene av frembringelsen som ansees å falle inn under definisjonen av «frembringelse» for denne lisensens formål utelukkende fordi de møter kriteriene for vern etter åndsverklovens § 43 og EUs databasedirektiv.
Ideelle rettigheter forblir uberørt av denne lisensen, i den utstrekning de i henhold til gjeldende rett anerkjennes og ikke er fraskrivbare.
5. Garantier og ansvarsfraskrivelse

Med mindre annet er gjensidig og skriftlig avtalt mellom partene, tilbyr lisensgiver frembringelsen som den er og gir ingen garantier, verken uttrykkelig eller implisitt om kvalitet, egnethet, inngrep, presisjon, fravær av synlige eller skjulte feil og mangler, eller lignende. Enkelte jurisdiksjoner tillater ikke utelatelsen av implisitte garantier. I så fall gjelder dette ikke for deg.

6. Ansvarsbegrensning. Med de unntak som er påkrevd etter gjeldende rett, er ikke lisensgiver i noe tilfelle ansvarlig ovenfor deg for noen skade som oppstår som følge av lisensen eller bruk av frembringelsen, selv om lisensgiver blir gjort oppmerksom på muligheten for slik skade.

7. Opphør

Denne lisensen og de rettigheter som følger av den, vil automatisk opphøre ved ethvert brudd fra deg på lisensens vilkår. Enkeltpersoner eller juridiske personer som har mottatt bearbeidelser eller samlinger fra deg i henhold til lisensen, vil imidlertid ikke få sine lisenser brakt til opphør forutsatt at disse enkeltpersonene eller juridiske personene fullt ut overholder lisensens vilkår. Punktene 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 og 8 overlever ethvert opphør av denne lisensen.
I overensstemmelse med ovenstående vilkår er denne lisensen tidsubegrenset (i frembringelsens opphavsrettslige vernetid). Uavhengig av det foregående, forbeholder lisensgiver seg likevel retten til å utgi frembringelsen under andre lisensvilkår eller å stoppe distribusjonen av frembringelsen på ethvert tidspunkt. Dette forutsetter imidlertid at ethvert slikt valg ikke vil tjene til å trekke tilbake denne lisensen (eller enhver annen lisens som har vært gitt under vilkårene til denne lisensen). Lisensen gjelder fullt ut med mindre den opphører som nevnt ovenfor.

En part skal ikke anses for å ha gitt avkall på å gjøre vilkår gjeldende eller å ha tillatt brudd på vilkår i denne lisensen, med mindre dette har skjedd skriftlig og er underskrevet av denne part.

For the purpose of this Licence, when not inconsistent with the context, words in the singular number include the plural number.
2. Licence Terms
2.1 Subject to the terms of this agreement the Licensor hereby grants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, Licence for use and for the duration of copyright in the Work.
You may:
copy the Work;
create one or more Adaptations. You must take reasonable steps to ensure any Adaptation clearly identifies that changes were made to the original Work;
incorporate the Work into one or more Collections;
copy Adaptations or the Work as incorporated in any Collection; and
publish, distribute, archive, perform or otherwise disseminate the Work, Adaptation or the Work as incorporated in any Collection, to the public.
All these rights may be exercised in any material form in any media whether now known or hereafter created. All these rights also include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats.
HOWEVER,
You must not:
impose any terms on the use to be made of the Work, the Adaptation or the Work as incorporated in a Collection that alter or restrict the terms of this Licence or any rights granted under it or have the effect or intent of restricting the ability to exercise those rights;
impose any digital rights management technology on the Work, the Adaptation or the Work as incorporated in a Collection that alters or restricts the terms of this Licence or any rights granted under it or has the effect or intent of restricting the ability to exercise those rights;
sublicense the Work;
falsely Attribute the Work to someone other than the Original Author;
subject the Work to any derogatory treatment as defined in the Copyright Act 1994 provided that if the Licensor is the Original Author the Licensor will not enforce this sub-clause to the extent necessary to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under clause 2.1 to make Adaptations but not otherwise.
FINALLY,
You must:
make reference to this Licence (by Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), spoken word or as appropriate to the media used) on all copies of the Work and Adaptations and Collections published, distributed, performed or otherwise disseminated or made available to the public by You;
recognise the Licensor's / Original Author's right of Attribution (right to be identified) in any Work, Adaptation and Collection that You publish, distribute, perform or otherwise disseminate to the public and ensure that You credit the Licensor / Original Author as appropriate to the media used. You will however remove such a credit if requested by the Licensor/Original Author;
not assert or imply any connection with sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author or Licensor of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author or Licensor; and
to the extent reasonably practicable, keep intact all notices that refer to this Licence, in particular the URI, if any, that the Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work.
Additional Provisions
2.2. Further licence from the Licensor
Each time You publish, distribute, perform or otherwise disseminate
the Work; or
any Adaptation; or
the Work as incorporated in a Collection
the Licensor agrees to offer to the relevant third party making use of the Work (“User”) (in any of the alternatives set out above) a licence to use the Work on the same terms and conditions as granted to You hereunder.
2.3. This Licence does not affect any rights that the User may have under any applicable law, including fair use, fair dealing or any other legally recognised limitation or exception to copyright infringement.
2.4. All rights not expressly granted by the Licensor are hereby reserved.
2.5. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or via a licensing body such as a collecting society, for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this Licence.
2.6. If the Licensor is the Original Author the Licensor waives its moral right to object to derogatory treatments of the Work to the extent necessary to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under this Licence to make Adaptations but not otherwise. If the Licensor is not the Original Author the Work will still be subject to the moral rights of the Original Author.
3. Warranties and Disclaimer
Except as required by law or as otherwise agreed in writing between the parties, the Work or any Adaptation is licensed by the Licensor on an “as is” and “as available” basis and without any warranty of any kind, either express or implied.
4. Limit of Liability
Subject to any liability which may not be excluded or limited by law the Licensor shall not be liable on any legal basis (including without limitation negligence) and hereby expressly excludes all liability for loss or damage howsoever and whenever caused to You.
5. Termination
The rights granted to You under this Licence shall terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this Licence. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this Licence, however, will not have their Licences terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those Licences. Clauses 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 will survive any termination of this Licence.
6. General
6.1. The validity or enforceability of the remaining terms of this agreement is not affected by the holding of any provision of it to be invalid or unenforceable.
6.2. This Licence constitutes the entire Licence Agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication in any form.
6.3. A person who is not a party to this Licence shall have no rights under the Contracts (Privity) Act 1982 to enforce any of its terms.
7. On the role of Creative Commons
7.1. Creative Commons does not authorise either the Licensor or the User to use the trade mark “Creative Commons” or any related trade mark, including the Creative Commons logo, except to indicate that the Work is licensed under a Creative Commons Licence. Any permitted use has to be in compliance with the Creative Commons trade mark usage guidelines at the time of use of the Creative Commons trade mark. These guidelines may be found on the Creative Commons website or be otherwise available upon request from time to time. For the avoidance of doubt this trade mark restriction does not form part of this Licence.
7.2. Creative Commons Corporation does not profit financially from its role in providing this Licence and will not investigate the claims of any Licensor or user of the Licence.
7.3. One of the conditions that Creative Commons Corporation requires of the Licensor and You is an acknowledgement of its limited role and agreement by all who use the Licence that the Corporation is not responsible to anyone for the statements and actions of You or the Licensor or anyone else attempting to use or using this Licence.
7.4. Creative Commons Corporation is not a party to this Licence, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection to the Work or in connection to the Licence, and in all events is not liable for any loss or damage resulting from the Licensor's or Your reliance on this Licence or on its enforceability.
7.5. USE OF THIS LICENCE MEANS THAT YOU AND THE LICENSOR EACH ACCEPTS THESE CONDITIONS IN SECTION 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4 AND EACH ACKNOWLEDGES CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION'S VERY LIMITED ROLE AS A FACILITATOR OF THE LICENCE FROM THE LICENSOR TO YOU.

Any permitted use will be in compliance with Creative Commons' then-current trademark usage guidelines, as may be published on its website or otherwise made available upon request from time to time.
